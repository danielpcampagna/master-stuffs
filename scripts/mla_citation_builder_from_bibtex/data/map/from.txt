Following Noy and McGuinness [[noy2001ontology]], we began by clearly delineating the boundaries of our model to address specific questions from the GDPR Guidance for SMEs [[Guidance]] that are not yet covered in the literature. We employed competency questions to determine the domain scope and ensure our model addresses the necessary aspects of GDPR compliance for small and medium enterprises.

We explored existing approaches to identify reusable concepts and assess which parts of the domain have already been represented. Utilizing a systematic mapping methodology [[wohlin2014guidelines]], we analyzed 321 documents and identified eight papers relevant to our objectives. Comparing these against the compliance questions revealed that certain obligations remain unrepresented, highlighting the need for our extended model.

With the gaps identified, we introduced new concepts to the domain, aligning with steps 2-6 of Noy and McGuinness's method [[noy2001ontology]] and leveraging NeON's guidance on reusing and merging tasks [[suarez2012neon]]. We characterized the lacking terms, explored their hierarchical relationships, and determined how different knowledge sources could be integrated. This systematic workflow allowed us to propose concepts essential for representing the targeted compliance questions, providing a foundation for future models and facilitating critique and refinement.

We assessed whether our model effectively represents the defined scope by instantiating use cases and representing competency questions as SPARQL queries. Noy and McGuinness advocate for using instances to validate models [[noy2001ontology]], while NeON emphasizes evaluating both the model's correctness and the methodology followed [[suarez2012neon]]. To assess the quality of our model's design, we employed the OntOlogy Pitfall Scanner! (OOPS!) [[poveda2014oops]], which identifies potential pitfalls and categorizes them by importance, ensuring our model adheres to best practices in ontology engineering.
Throughout the development process, we adhered to fundamental principles of ontology engineering as outlined by Noy and McGuinness [[noy2001ontology]]:
