#### Summary:

**Title:** A provenance model for the European union general data protection regulation  
**Authors:** Ujcich, Benjamin E and Bates, Adam and Sanders, William H  
**Year:** 2018  
**Place:** IPAW  

**Problem it addresses:**
The paper addresses the challenge of ensuring compliance with the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which imposes strict requirements on data processing activities, including data provenance (the history of data, including its origins and transformations).

**Methodology used:**
The authors propose a provenance model specifically designed to meet GDPR requirements. They develop an ontology to capture the necessary provenance information and demonstrate how this model can be applied to ensure GDPR compliance.

**Key contributions:**
- **Provenance Model:** Introduction of a detailed provenance model tailored to the requirements of GDPR.
- **Ontology Design:** Development of an ontology to systematically represent and track data provenance in compliance with GDPR.
- **Compliance Demonstration:** Practical demonstration of how the proposed model can be applied to real-world data processing activities to ensure GDPR compliance.

**Related work:**
The paper references prior work on data provenance, GDPR requirements, and existing provenance models, although specific related works are not listed in the summary.

**Evaluation of their contribution:**
The authors evaluated their provenance model by applying it to hypothetical scenarios and demonstrating its ability to capture and represent the necessary data provenance information required by GDPR.

**Future work it recommends:**
The paper suggests further refinement of the provenance model and ontology to cover more complex data processing scenarios and integration with existing data management systems.

**Model and Technologies used:**
- **Ontology:** The model is built upon an ontology to represent data provenance.
- **Technologies:** The specific technologies mentioned include RDF (Resource Description Framework) for representing the ontology and provenance data.
