# Tom, Jake and Sing, Eduard and Matulevicius, Raimundas. Conceptual representation of the GDPR: model and application directions. 2018.

> [Link to publication](https://example.com/publication) 

## Approach and Motivations

The paper "Conceptual representation of the GDPR: model and application directions" by Tom, Jake, Sing, and Matulevicius proposes a model to systematically represent the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) guidelines. The primary motivation behind this approach is to provide a structured way to manage and track compliance with GDPR requirements. This is achieved by developing a conceptual model that encapsulates the key elements of GDPR and demonstrates how organizations can apply these in their data processing activities.

The structure of the paper outlines the development of the GDPRov model, which provides a formal representation of GDPR-related concepts. The model focuses on the relationships between data controllers, data processors, data subjects, and the personal data being processed. The model includes components such as `DataCategory`, `DataSubject`, `Purpose`, `Consent`, and `ProcessingActivity`.

The motivation for this approach stems from the need for organizations to have a comprehensive tool to ensure GDPR compliance, reduce the risk of non-compliance, and streamline data protection processes. By representing the GDPR requirements conceptually, the authors aim to bridge the gap between legal regulations and practical implementation.

## Approach Contribution For The Compliance Questions

### Question 28

The GDPRov model includes components such as `DataCategory`, `DataSubject`, and `ProcessingActivity` which can be leveraged to ensure personal data is kept up to date and accurate. For example, the `ProcessingActivity` component can be used to track updates and corrections to personal data, ensuring that any necessary changes are made without delay.

### Question 63

The model's `DataCategory` and `ProcessingActivity` components can help list all transfers, including the nature of the data and the purpose of the processing. Additionally, the `Transfer` component can capture information about the source and destination countries and the recipient of the data transfer, ensuring detailed documentation of all data transfers.

### Question 64

The `LegalBasis` component in the GDPRov model can be used to document the legal basis for data transfers. This component can capture information such as EU Commission adequacy decisions or standard contractual clauses, ensuring that all legal bases for data transfers are well-documented and accessible.

## Approach Insufficiencies For Fulfill The Compliance Questions

### Question 8

The GDPRov model does not explicitly include a component to specify the retention period for each category of personal data. While the `ProcessingActivity` component can track data processing activities, it lacks a direct mechanism to define and enforce data retention policies.

### Question 29

Similarly, the model does not provide a specific component for retention policies and procedures. Although `ProcessingActivity` tracks data usage, it does not inherently include the necessary features to ensure data retention aligns with the purposes for which the data was collected.

### Question 51

The model does not have a dedicated component to systematically manage the destruction, erasure, or anonymization of personal data when it is no longer legally required. The absence of such a component means the model does not fully address the systematic disposal of data.

## Key Contributions

- **Development of GDPRov Model**:
  - `DataCategory`
  - `DataSubject`
  - `Purpose`
  - `Consent`
  - `ProcessingActivity`
  - `Transfer`
  - `LegalBasis`
- **Structured Representation of GDPR**: Provides a formal framework for representing GDPR concepts and relationships.
- **Facilitates GDPR Compliance**: Assists organizations in tracking and managing GDPR compliance efficiently.
- **Application Directions**: Offers practical guidelines on how the model can be applied in real-world scenarios.

## State-of-the-Art

The approach presented in the paper advances the state-of-the-art by offering a structured and formal representation of GDPR requirements. This model bridges the gap between legal regulations and practical implementation, providing a comprehensive tool for organizations to manage GDPR compliance.

Compared to previous models, GDPRov introduces a more detailed and interconnected representation of GDPR components. It allows for more effective tracking of data processing activities, consent management, and legal basis documentation. However, it still lacks specific components for data retention policies and systematic data disposal, which are critical for full compliance.

Related works in this domain include various data protection frameworks and models, but GDPRov stands out due to its detailed representation of GDPR-specific requirements and its practical application directions. Future work could focus on extending the model to cover additional compliance questions and integrating it with existing data governance tools.
