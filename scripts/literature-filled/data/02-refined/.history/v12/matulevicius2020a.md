# Matulevicius, Raimundas and Tom, Jake and Kala, Kaspar and Sing, Eduard. A Method for Managing GDPR Compliance in Business Processes. 2020. CAiSE.

## Approach and Motivations

This publication introduces a structured method to manage GDPR compliance within business processes. The approach is motivated by the need for organizations to ensure that their data processing activities comply with the stringent requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The methodology is designed to help organizations systematically address compliance issues by mapping their business processes against GDPR requirements.

The paper outlines several key components crucial for achieving compliance. These include the `GDPR model`, which encapsulates the essential aspects of GDPR, and the `Method for achieving compliance`, which provides a systematic approach to align business processes with GDPR mandates. The approach also involves `Extracting AS-IS compliance model` to understand current compliance status, `Comparing two models` to identify gaps, and `Defining compliance issues` to pinpoint specific areas needing improvement. Finally, the methodology proposes `Changing business process model` to ensure ongoing compliance.

## Approach Contribution For The Compliance Questions

### Question 8
The `GDPR model` component can partially address Question 8 by specifying data retention policies as part of the compliance framework. However, detailing the exact retention periods for each category of personal data might require additional specific components or extensions to the existing model.

### Question 28
The approach includes mechanisms for `Defining compliance issues`, which could help identify and address the need for procedures to keep personal data up to date and accurate. This component ensures that necessary corrections are made without delay, aligning with the requirements of Question 28.

### Question 29
The `GDPR model` and the `Method for achieving compliance` components can help establish retention policies ensuring data are held no longer than necessary. These components can guide the creation and enforcement of such policies, partially answering Question 29.

### Question 51
The approach's focus on `Changing business process model` can ensure that personal data is systematically destroyed, erased, or anonymized when no longer legally required. This ensures compliance with Question 51.

### Question 63
While the `GDPR model` can outline general requirements for data transfer documentation, it may not fully encompass all the specifics required by Question 63, such as listing all transfers and detailed information about the nature of the data and the purpose of the processing.

### Question 64
The `GDPR model` can partially address Question 64 by documenting the legal basis for data transfers. However, it may require additional documentation to comprehensively cover all legal bases and ensure they are adequately recorded.

## Approach Insuficiecies For Fulfill The Compliance Questions

### Question 8
The approach lacks specific components to detail the retention periods for different categories of personal data comprehensively. While the `GDPR model` provides a framework, it does not specify retention periods, which are crucial for full compliance with Question 8.

### Question 29
Although the `GDPR model` and `Method for achieving compliance` help establish retention policies, they may not provide the detailed procedural steps necessary to ensure thorough compliance with the retention requirements outlined in Question 29.

### Question 63
The existing components of the approach do not fully cover the detailed documentation required for all data transfers, including specifics about the nature of the data and the transfer process. This makes it insufficient to fully address Question 63.

### Question 64
While the `GDPR model` includes documentation of legal bases for data transfers, it may not fully capture all necessary details or provide a comprehensive record of these bases, limiting its effectiveness in answering Question 64.

## State-of-the-Art

This approach significantly advances the state-of-the-art by providing a structured methodology for managing GDPR compliance within business processes. It offers a comprehensive framework that organizations can use to map their processes against GDPR requirements, identify compliance gaps, and implement necessary changes. The related work in this domain typically focuses on specific aspects of GDPR compliance, but this approach offers a holistic solution by integrating multiple components to address various compliance issues.
