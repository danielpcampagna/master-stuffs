### Comprehensive Summary

**Title:** A provenance model for the European union general data protection regulation  
**Authors:** Ujcich, Benjamin E and Bates, Adam and Sanders, William H  
**Year:** 2018  
**Place:** IPAW  

#### Problem it addresses
The paper addresses the challenge of ensuring compliance with the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Specifically, it focuses on the need for a robust data provenance model that can document and verify compliance with GDPR mandates related to data processing activities.

#### Approach Utilized
The authors propose a provenance model tailored to meet the requirements of GDPR. The approach utilizes technologies like **PROV** (Provenance Data Model) and extensions to PROV to capture the necessary information for GDPR compliance.

#### Introduced Model/Ontology
The paper introduces a provenance model specifically designed for GDPR compliance. The main components of this model include:

- **Data Subject**: The individual to whom the personal data belongs.
- **Data Controller**: The entity that determines the purpose and means of processing the personal data.
- **Data Processor**: The entity that processes data on behalf of the data controller.
- **Processing Activities**: The operations performed on personal data.
- **Consent**: The data subject's permission to process their data.
- **Data Transfer**: The movement of data across different entities or jurisdictions.
- **Data Retention**: The duration for which data is stored.

#### Methodology Used
The methodology involves extending the existing PROV model to incorporate GDPR-specific requirements. This includes defining new entities, relationships, and attributes that cover the various aspects of data processing as mandated by GDPR.

#### Key Contributions
- Introduction of a provenance model explicitly designed for GDPR compliance.
- Extension of the PROV model with GDPR-specific entities and relationships.
- A detailed mapping of GDPR articles to the proposed provenance model components.
- Demonstration of how the model can be used to document and verify GDPR compliance.

#### Advancements to State-of-the-Art
The proposed model advances the state-of-the-art by providing a structured and formalized way to capture and verify compliance with GDPR. This is especially significant given the stringent requirements of GDPR and the heavy penalties for non-compliance.

#### Evaluation of Contribution
The contribution was evaluated through a series of use cases that demonstrate how the provenance model can be applied to real-world data processing scenarios. These use cases illustrate the model's effectiveness in capturing the necessary information
