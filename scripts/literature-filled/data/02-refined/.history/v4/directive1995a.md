The publication titled "Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data" is a non-scientific publication. It's a legal document enacted by the European Union that sets out comprehensive rules regarding the protection of personal data, its processing, and the free movement of such data. This directive has been superseded by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) since May 2018. As a legislative text, it does not follow the structure of a scientific research paper and does not offer findings from empirical studies. Instead, it provides a legal framework for data protection in the EU.
