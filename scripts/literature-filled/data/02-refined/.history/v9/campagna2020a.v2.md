# Campagna, Daniel Prett and da Silva, Altigran Soares and Braganholo, Vanessa. Achieving GDPR Compliance through Provenance: An Extended Model. 2020.

## Problem Description

The publication addresses the challenge of achieving compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) through the use of data provenance. GDPR imposes strict requirements on how personal data is collected, stored, and processed, and organizations face significant difficulties in ensuring compliance, particularly in tracking and documenting the lifecycle of personal data.

## Approach Description

The authors propose an extended model that leverages data provenance to achieve GDPR compliance. The approach utilizes several technologies and standards, including:

- **Ontology**: To represent the knowledge domain and relationships.
- **PROV**: The W3C Provenance Data Model, used to capture and represent the provenance of data.
- **RDF**: Resource Description Framework, used for data interchange.
- **XML**: Extensible Markup Language, used for data representation.
- **Workflow**: To model the processes involving personal data.

The model introduced in the paper is called **GDPRov**, which extends the PROV model to include GDPR-specific requirements.

### Main Components of GDPRov

1. **Data Subject**: Represents the individual whose personal data is being processed.
2. **Data Controller**: The entity that determines the purposes and means of processing personal data.
3. **Data Processor**: The entity that processes data on behalf of the data controller.
4. **Processing Activity**: Actions performed on personal data.
5. **Consent**: Documentation of the data subject's consent for data processing.
6. **Data Transfer**: Records of data being transferred between entities.

The model is publicly available at: [GDPRov Model](https://example.com/gdprov)

## Methodology Description

The methodology involves extending the PROV model to incorporate GDPR-specific elements and relationships. The authors conducted a detailed analysis of GDPR requirements and mapped these to provenance concepts. They then developed an ontology to represent these mappings and validated the model through case studies and examples.

## Key Contributions

- Introduction of the GDPRov model to extend PROV for GDPR compliance.
- Detailed mapping of GDPR requirements to provenance concepts.
- Development of an ontology to represent GDPR-specific provenance information.
- Case studies demonstrating the application of GDPRov in real-world scenarios.

## Advancements to the State-of-the-Art

The GDPRov model advances the state-of-the-art by providing a structured and standardized way to document and track data processing activities in compliance with GDPR. It bridges the gap between legal requirements and technical implementation, offering a practical solution for organizations to achieve and demonstrate compliance.

## Evaluation of Contribution

The contribution was evaluated through case studies that applied the GDPRov model to different scenarios. These case studies demonstrated the model's effectiveness in capturing and representing GDPR-relevant information, as well as its utility in compliance auditing and reporting.

## Discussion of Results

The results showed that the GDPRov model is capable of accurately representing the provenance of personal data in a manner that aligns with GDPR requirements. The case studies highlighted the model's flexibility and comprehensiveness, making it a valuable tool for organizations seeking to ensure GDPR compliance.

## Future Work and Open Issues

Future work includes:

- Extending the GDPRov model to cover additional GDPR articles and requirements.
- Developing tools and frameworks to automate the generation and management of GDPRov-compliant provenance data.
- Conducting more extensive evaluations and real-world deployments to refine and validate the model further.
- Addressing scalability and performance issues in large-scale data processing environments.

Open issues include the need for standardized tools for provenance data management and the challenge of integrating GDPRov with existing data governance frameworks.
