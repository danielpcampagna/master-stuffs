# Pandit, Harshvardhan Jitendra. Representing Activities associated with Processing of Personal Data and Consent using Semantic Web for GDPR Compliance. 2020.

## Approach and Motivations

The publication by Harshvardhan Jitendra Pandit presents GDPRov, a data provenance model designed to assist data controllers in tracking activities and consent information related to the processing of personal data in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This approach leverages the Semantic Web to create a structured and standardized way of documenting and querying GDPR-related processes. The motivation behind this work is to address the complexities and challenges faced by organizations in demonstrating GDPR compliance, specifically focusing on the provenance of activities and consent mechanisms.

The model uses PROV-O, a W3C standard for representing provenance information, and P-Plan, an extension of PROV-O designed to describe scientific workflows. These ontologies enable the representation of both ex-ante (planned) and ex-post (executed) phases of activities, ensuring that compliance can be demonstrated through documented planning and actual execution. This dual-phase representation is crucial for GDPR compliance, as it allows organizations to show that they have not only planned their data processing activities in accordance with GDPR requirements but have also executed them as planned.

GDPRov is designed to be extensible and interoperable, incorporating concepts from other relevant ontologies such as GDPRtEXT, which provides a textual representation of GDPR legal requirements. This integration allows for more comprehensive and precise queries, facilitating better compliance management.

## Approach Contribution For The Compliance Questions

### Question 8: Data Retention Periods
The approach partially addresses this question by enabling the representation of planned and executed activities related to data retention. However, it does not explicitly capture the retention periods for each category of personal data. 

### Question 28: Data Accuracy and Updates
GDPRov can represent activities related to data processing and consent but does not specifically address procedures for ensuring data accuracy and updates. The model could be extended to include such procedures, but it currently lacks explicit support for this requirement.

### Question 29: Retention Policies and Procedures
While GDPRov can document planned and executed data processing activities, it does not explicitly capture retention policies and procedures. The model provides a foundation for representing such information but would need additional components to fully address this question.

### Question 51: Data Destruction, Erasure, or Anonymization
The approach can document activities related to data processing, but it does not explicitly include mechanisms for representing data destruction, erasure, or anonymization. These activities could be inferred from the provenance information but are not directly supported.

### Question 63: Data Transfers
GDPRov could represent data transfers as part of the documented activities, including details such as the nature of the data and the purpose of processing. However, it does not explicitly capture all the required details, such as the countries involved and the recipient of the transfer.

### Question 64: Legal Basis for Data Transfers
The model does not explicitly capture the legal basis for data transfers, such as EU Commission adequacy decisions or standard contractual clauses. This information could be integrated into the model but is not currently supported.

## Approach Insuficiencies For Fulfill The Compliance Questions

GDPRov provides a robust framework for documenting data processing activities and consent mechanisms, but it lacks specific components to address some of the detailed compliance questions fully. For instance, the model does not explicitly capture retention periods, data accuracy procedures, or legal bases for data transfers. While these aspects could potentially be integrated into the model, they are not part of the current implementation, limiting its ability to fully answer certain compliance questions.

## Key Contributions

- Development of GDPRov, a data provenance model for GDPR compliance.
- Use of PROV-O and P-Plan to represent ex-ante and ex-post phases of data processing activities.
- Integration with GDPRtEXT for textual representation of GDPR requirements.
- Extensible and interoperable framework for representing GDPR-related activities and consent mechanisms.

## State-of-the-Art

GDPRov advances the state-of-the-art by providing a novel approach to GDPR compliance management through the use of Semantic Web technologies. Unlike other models that primarily focus on data processing activities, GDPRov uniquely uses PROV-O and P-Plan to represent both planned and executed activities. This dual-phase representation is critical for demonstrating compliance with GDPR requirements, as it shows that organizations have both planned and executed their data processing activities in accordance with the regulation.

Additionally, GDPRov's integration with GDPRtEXT allows for more precise and comprehensive queries, facilitating better compliance management. While other approaches, such as the SPECIAL project, also utilize provenance vocabularies for GDPR compliance, GDPRov differentiates itself by focusing on the association between ex-ante and ex-post phases of activities. This focus on both planning and execution provides a more holistic view of GDPR compliance.

Overall, GDPRov presents a significant advancement in the state-of-the-art by offering a comprehensive, extensible, and interoperable framework for managing GDPR compliance through the Semantic Web.
