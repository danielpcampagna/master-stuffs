# Campagna, Daniel Prett and da Silva, Altigran Soares and Braganholo, Vanessa. Achieving GDPR Compliance through Provenance: An Extended Model. 2020.

## Problem Description

The publication addresses the problem of enforcing compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) through data provenance. It highlights the challenges posed by GDPR in terms of ensuring transparent and compliant data treatment processes and the technical difficulties that organizations face, which, if not managed properly, could result in heavy fines.

## Approach Description

The authors propose an extended data provenance model to achieve better GDPR compliance. The approach is based on improving existing models by including more comprehensive representations and ensuring alignment with GDPR requirements. Key technologies and concepts used include:
- **Ontology**: To model data protection requirements.
- **Provenance Graphs**: To visualize and track data lineage.
- **PROV Ontology**: To describe the provenance information.
- **GDPRov**: An extension of the P-Plan ontology for modeling workflows.
- **Compatibility Relationship**: To assess if data usage purposes are compatible with user consent.

## Methodology Description

The methodology involves analyzing the existing GDPR data provenance model by Ujcich et al. [2018] and comparing it with the GDPR text to identify gaps. The authors then propose eleven extensions to the model to address these gaps. The extensions are categorized based on their impact on the model. Two design patterns are also introduced to guide the practical application of these extensions.

## Key Contributions

- Identification of eleven limitations in the existing GDPR data provenance model.
- Proposals for extensions to address these limitations.
- Introduction of two design patterns for practical application of the extended model.
- Enhanced representation of GDPR compliance in provenance models.

## Advancement of the State-of-the-Art

The extended model advances the state-of-the-art by providing a more comprehensive and GDPR-compliant provenance model. It improves the flexibility and applicability of the model without requiring pre-specification of workflows, making it easier to adapt to various data processing scenarios.

## Evaluation of Contribution

The evaluation is conducted through a detailed analysis of the GDPR text and its comparison with the existing model. The proposed extensions are theoretically validated against the GDPR requirements to ensure compliance and completeness.

## Discussion of Results

The discussion highlights the improved transparency and compliance of the extended model. It addresses the identified gaps and provides a more robust framework for GDPR compliance through data provenance.

## Future Work and Open Issues

Future work includes practical implementation and validation of the proposed model in real-world scenarios. The authors also mention the need for multidisciplinary approaches to address practical issues such as metadata management, inter-controller audits, and ensuring fraud-resistant provenance collection mechanisms.
