# Campagna, Daniel Prett, da Silva, Altigran Soares, and Braganholo, Vanessa. Achieving GDPR Compliance through Provenance: An Extended Model. 2020.

## Problem Description

The paper addresses the challenge of achieving compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) using data provenance. The GDPR introduces technical challenges and compliance requirements that, if unmet, can result in significant fines. Existing provenance models are not fully compliant with GDPR, necessitating an extended model to bridge this gap.

## Approach Description

The approach involves extending the GDPR data provenance model proposed by Ujcich et al. The authors suggest eleven new changes to make the model more transparent and compatible with the GDPR text. The technologies and methodologies used include:
- **Ontology**: For modeling GDPR concepts.
- **PROV**: The W3C provenance model, which uses entities, activities, and agents.
- **UML**: For diagrammatic representation of the model.
- **RDF**: For semantic representation and linking of data.

## Methodology Description

The authors conducted a non-systematic read and interpretation of the GDPR text to identify limitations in the existing model. They then proposed extensions to address these limitations and presented design patterns to guide the use of these changes in real contexts.

## Key Contributions

- Eleven new changes to the GDPR data provenance model to enhance compatibility with GDPR.
- Two design patterns for practical implementation of the extended model.
- Detailed analysis of the existing model's limitations in relation to GDPR articles.
- Introduction of new classes and relationships to better represent GDPR requirements.

## How the Current Model Advances the State-of-the-Art

The extended model provides a more comprehensive representation of GDPR requirements, addressing previously unrepresented aspects such as the period for data storage, further processing for other purposes, and special categories of personal data. This makes the model more practical and aligned with GDPR compliance needs.

## Evaluation of Contribution

The contribution was evaluated through a comprehensive practical case study involving an online retail shop. The case study demonstrated how the extended model and proposed design patterns could be applied to real-world scenarios, ensuring GDPR compliance.

## Discussion of Results

The results showed that the extended model successfully addresses the identified limitations of the original model. The design patterns provided clear guidance on implementing the model in practical contexts, enhancing transparency and compliance with GDPR.

## Future Work and Open Issues

Future work includes:
- Practical approaches to help organizations achieve true GDPR compliance.
- Addressing practical issues such as metadata management, inter-controller audits, and ensuring fraud-resistance in provenance collection mechanisms.
- Further collaborative efforts to minimize bureaucratic tasks and maximize process transparency.
