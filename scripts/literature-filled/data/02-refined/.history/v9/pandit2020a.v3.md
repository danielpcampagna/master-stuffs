# Pandit, Harshvardhan Jitendra. Representing Activities associated with Processing of Personal Data and Consent using Semantic Web for GDPR Compliance. 2020.

## Problem Description

The publication addresses the challenge of representing and managing information associated with GDPR compliance, specifically focusing on activities related to the processing of personal data and consent. It aims to leverage semantic web technologies to make information machine-readable, interoperable, and queryable, thus assisting with the compliance process.

## Approach Description

The approach utilizes several semantic web technologies and standards:
- **Ontology**: OWL2 for creating ontologies.
- **RDF**: For representing information in a machine-readable format.
- **SPARQL**: For querying information.
- **SHACL**: For validating information.
- **PROV-O**: An ontology for representing provenance information, used to model activities and data related to GDPR compliance.
- **Linked Data**: To automate and manage compliance documentation.

The publication introduces three primary components:
1. **GDPRtEXT**: A linked data representation of the text of GDPR and a glossary of relevant concepts.
2. **GDPRov**: An OWL2 ontology based on PROV-O for modeling activities associated with personal data and consent in both planning (ex-ante) and execution (ex-post) phases.
3. **GConsent**: An OWL2 ontology for representing information regarding consent.

## Methodology Description

The methodology involves:
- Developing ontologies to represent GDPR-related information.
- Utilizing RDF for data representation.
- Using SPARQL for querying the represented data.
- Applying SHACL for data validation.
- Demonstrating the applicability and feasibility of the developed models through examples and use cases.

## Key Contributions

- **GDPRtEXT**: A linked data representation of GDPR text and glossary.
- **GDPRov**: An ontology for modeling activities related to personal data and consent.
- **GConsent**: An ontology for representing consent information.
- Application of semantic web technologies to query and validate information using SPARQL and SHACL.

## Advancement of State-of-the-Art

The current model advances the state-of-the-art by:
- Providing a machine-readable, interoperable, and queryable representation of GDPR-related data.
- Enabling automation in the management and documentation of GDPR compliance.
- Addressing gaps in representing complex processing operations and consent information.

## Evaluation of Contribution

The contribution was evaluated by:
- Demonstrating the use of the developed ontologies through specific use cases.
- Querying and validating information using SPARQL and SHACL.
- Discussing how the approach meets GDPR compliance requirements.

## Discussion About the Results

The results indicate that the use of semantic web technologies can effectively represent and manage GDPR compliance information. The approach demonstrates the feasibility of automating compliance documentation and querying information related to personal data processing and consent.

## Future Work and Open Issues

Future work involves:
- Extending the ontologies to cover more complex processing operations and multiple legal bases for data processing.
- Improving the representation of consent and rights information.
- Further validating the approach with real-world data and use cases.
- Enhancing the toolset for automated compliance verification.
