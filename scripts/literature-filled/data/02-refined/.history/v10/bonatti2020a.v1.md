# Bonatti, Piero A., Kirrane, Sabrina, Petrova, Iliana M., Sauro, Luigi. Machine Understandable Policies and GDPR Compliance Checking. 2020.

## Approach and Motivations

The paper introduces an approach developed within the SPECIAL H2020 project to address the compliance requirements set forth by the GDPR. The motivation behind this work stems from the need for technical and organizational measures to support GDPR implementation, specifically for automated compliance checking. The SPECIAL project aims to provide tools to assist data controllers and processors in ensuring their data processing activities align with GDPR mandates.

The approach involves the creation of a policy language that can express consent, business policies, and regulatory obligations in a machine-readable format. This policy language enables the automation of compliance checking, helping organizations demonstrate that data processing is consistent with the consent given by data subjects and adheres to regulatory requirements. The project also proposes two methods for automated compliance checking that leverage this policy language.

## Approach Contribution For The Compliance Questions

### Question 8

The SPECIAL policy language can be used to encode information about retention periods for different categories of personal data (`P5 - envisaged time limits for erasure`). This helps in specifying how long data will be retained, which is essential for compliance with GDPR.

### Question 28

The approach includes maintaining records of processing activities, which could potentially include procedures for ensuring data accuracy (`P6 - information about processing`). However, the paper does not explicitly address mechanisms to ensure data corrections are made without delay.

### Question 29

The policy language can be used to define retention policies, ensuring data is held no longer than necessary (`P5 - envisaged time limits for erasure`). This aligns with the requirement for retention policies and procedures.

### Question 51

The SPECIAL framework includes mechanisms for recording and managing consent, which could be extended to include data deletion or anonymization processes when data is no longer required (`P5 - envisaged time limits for erasure`).

### Question 63

The framework is designed to record detailed information about data processing activities, including data transfers (`P4 - transfers of personal data to a third country or an international organization`). This helps in listing all transfers, the nature of data, and the purpose of processing.

### Question 64

While the paper discusses the recording of consent and processing activities, it does not explicitly mention documenting the legal basis for data transfers.

## Approach Insuficiencies For Fulfill The Compliance Questions

### Question 28

The approach lacks specific mechanisms to ensure and verify that personal data is kept up to date and accurate. Although it can record processing activities, it does not provide tools for real-time data correction.

### Question 51

While the policy language can define retention policies, the approach does not explicitly address the systematic destruction, erasure, or anonymization of data when it is no longer legally required. Additional procedures and tools would be needed to fulfill this requirement completely.

### Question 64

The approach does not fully cover the documentation of the legal basis for data transfers, such as EU Commission adequacy decisions or standard contractual clauses, which are necessary for comprehensive compliance.

## Key Contributions

- Development of a policy language to express consent, business policies, and regulatory obligations.
- Introduction of two automated compliance checking methods.
- Creation of a transparency ledger to record consent and processing activities.
- Initial performance evaluation of the compliance checking algorithm.

## State-of-the-Art

This approach advances the state-of-the-art by integrating legal knowledge representation and reasoning with practical tools for GDPR compliance. It builds upon previous research in the Semantic Web community and policy languages, enhancing them with specific applications for GDPR.

The project addresses a significant gap in existing GDPR compliance tools, which often lack automated compliance checking capabilities. By providing a machine-readable policy language and compliance checking methods, the SPECIAL project offers a more efficient and scalable solution for organizations to demonstrate GDPR compliance.

Related work includes foundational research on legal informatics and existing GDPR compliance tools, which typically use predefined questionnaires. The SPECIAL project's contributions lie in its ability to automate these processes, reducing the burden on organizations and improving compliance accuracy.
