# Pandit, Harshvardhan Jitendra. Representing Activities associated with Processing of Personal Data and Consent using Semantic Web for GDPR Compliance. 2020.

## Approach and Motivations

The publication by Harshvardhan Jitendra Pandit introduces the GDPRov model, designed to assist data controllers in tracking activities and consent information related to the processing of personal data in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The model aims to create a comprehensive representation of the processes associated with personal data and consent, ensuring that they are documented in a manner that demonstrates prior planning and execution for compliance.

The approach taken involves identifying the requirements from competency questions and analyzing them to ensure that they are cohesive as an ontology. The model provides ex-ante and ex-post representations, enabling documentation of both the planning and execution phases of data processing activities. This helps in demonstrating compliance with GDPR requirements by linking information between these phases.

The motivations behind this approach include the need for a structured and validated method to ensure GDPR compliance and the necessity to represent various activities, including consent mechanisms and data processing agreements, in a cohesive manner.

## Approach Contribution For The Compliance Questions

**Question 8: For each category of personal data, list the period for which the data will be retained e.g. one month? one year?**

- The `GDPRov` model can represent information about data retention periods by associating categories of personal data with their respective retention periods. However, the specific implementation details regarding how this retention information is stored and managed are not thoroughly covered.

**Question 28: Are procedures in place to ensure personal data is kept up to date and accurate and where a correction is required, the necessary changes are made without delay?**

- The model includes components for documenting processes and activities related to personal data. It can, therefore, potentially represent procedures for updating and correcting data, but detailed mechanisms for ensuring accuracy and timeliness of updates are not explicitly discussed.

## Approach Insuficiecies For Fulfill The Compliance Questions

**Question 8:**
- While `GDPRov` can represent retention periods, it lacks specific components or mechanisms to manage and enforce these retention policies, making it insufficient to fully answer the question about data retention.

**Question 28:**
- The approach does not include detailed procedures or automated mechanisms to ensure that personal data is kept up to date and accurate. It only provides a framework for documenting such activities.

## Key Contributions

- Development of the `GDPRov` model for representing activities and consent related to personal data processing.
- Creation of ex-ante and ex-post representations to document planning and execution phases of data processing.
- Use of Semantic Web technologies to ensure structured and validated information representation.
- Contribution to understanding complexities of consent management and GDPR compliance.

## State-of-the-Art

The `GDPRov` model advances the state-of-the-art by providing a structured approach to documenting GDPR compliance activities. It integrates Semantic Web technologies to create a cohesive ontology that links planning and execution phases of data processing. This approach is crucial for ensuring that compliance documentation is both comprehensive and verifiable.

Compared to previous models, `GDPRov` includes more detailed representations of consent mechanisms and data processing activities. It addresses the need for validated information structures that can be used to demonstrate compliance with regulatory requirements.

However, the model still has limitations, particularly in its ability to manage and enforce data retention policies and ensure data accuracy. Future work could expand on these areas to create a more comprehensive compliance management system.
