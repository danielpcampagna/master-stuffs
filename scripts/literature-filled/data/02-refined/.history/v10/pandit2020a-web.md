# PANDIT, HARSHVARDHAN JITENDRA. Representing Activities associated with Processing of Personal Data and Consent using Semantic Web for GDPR Compliance. 2020.

> https://w3id.org/GDPRov/

## Approach and Motivations

The study introduces GDPRov (GDPR Provenance Ontology), a model designed to represent activities associated with the processing of personal data and consent in compliance with GDPR. The primary motivation behind GDPRov is to aid data controllers in tracking activities and consent information related to personal data processing, ensuring compliance with GDPR. The ontology is based on concepts from PROV-O and P-Plan, extended to encapsulate ex-ante (planned) and ex-post (executed) activities. GDPRtEXT is utilized to define the source of concepts within the GDPR text, thus providing a robust and legally grounded framework for data provenance.

GDPRov includes components such as `Process` to represent planned activities, `Step` to denote activities interacting with data and agents, and properties like `isPartOfProcess` and `refersToProcess` to associate these components. The methodology employed ensures that the ontology is evaluated against compliance questions derived from authoritative sources, making it a reliable tool for GDPR compliance management.

## Approach Contribution For The Compliance Questions

### Question 29
GDPRov includes components like `Process` and `Step` which can be used to represent retention policies and procedures. `Process` can outline the procedures in place, while `Step` can detail the specific activities involved in ensuring data is held only as long as necessary.

## Approach Insuficiencies For Fulfill The Compliance Questions

### Question 8
The current version of GDPRov lacks specific components for detailing the retention period for each category of personal data. While `Process` and `Step` can outline activities, they do not provide a mechanism to specify the exact retention period for different data categories.

### Question 28
GDPRov does not include explicit components to ensure personal data is kept up to date and accurate or to document the necessary changes without delay. The model focuses more on the representation of activities rather than the accuracy and timeliness of data updates.

### Question 29
Although GDPRov can represent retention policies and procedures through `Process` and `Step`, it does not provide a comprehensive mechanism to ensure that data is held no longer than necessary. Additional mechanisms are required to enforce and verify these policies effectively.

### Question 51
The model does not include components specifically designed to ensure personal data is systematically destroyed, erased, or anonymised when no longer needed. GDPRov primarily focuses on documenting processes rather than enforcing data destruction policies.

### Question 63
GDPRov lacks components to list all data transfers, including the nature of the data, purpose of processing, and details of data transfers between countries. The model would need additional features to encapsulate this information comprehensively.

### Question 64
The current model does not provide a mechanism to document the legal basis for data transfers, such as adequacy decisions or standard contractual clauses. GDPRov requires enhancements to capture and document these legal bases effectively.

## Key Contributions

- Developed GDPRov ontology to aid in GDPR compliance.
  - `Process`
  - `Step`
  - `isPartOfProcess`
  - `refersToProcess`
- Utilized GDPRtEXT to define origin and relevance of concepts.
- Evaluated ontology using compliance questions to ensure it meets GDPR requirements.
- Published under a CC-by-4.0 license, making it openly accessible for further use and development.

## State-of-the-Art

GDPRov advances the state-of-the-art by providing a structured method for representing GDPR compliance activities using semantic web technologies. The ontology leverages established frameworks like PROV-O and P-Plan, extending them to meet GDPR-specific requirements. It offers a novel approach to documenting both planned and executed activities, ensuring data controllers can demonstrate compliance effectively.

The methodology used for developing GDPRov, including the use of compliance questions for evaluation, sets a new standard for creating legally grounded data provenance models. By integrating GDPRtEXT, the model ensures that all concepts are directly linked to the relevant GDPR text, providing a robust legal foundation.

Related work includes other ontologies and frameworks for data provenance and privacy, but GDPRov stands out by focusing specifically on GDPR compliance and by providing a comprehensive approach to documenting both ex-ante and ex-post activities. The open-access nature of GDPRov and its detailed documentation further enhance its applicability and potential for reuse in various compliance management systems.
