# Bonatti, P., Dullaert, W., Fern√°ndez, J. D., Kirrane, S., Milosevic, M., Polleres, A. The SPECIAL Policy Log Vocabulary. 2018.

## Approach and Motivations

The SPECIAL Policy Log Vocabulary provides a structured means to document and manage policies related to the processing of personal data. This approach facilitates compliance with data protection regulations such as the GDPR by enabling the systematic recording of consent, data processing activities, and related policies. The vocabulary leverages Semantic Web technologies to ensure that policy information can be represented in a machine-readable format, promoting interoperability and automation in compliance processes.

The approach is motivated by the need for organizations to demonstrate accountability and transparency in their data processing activities. By providing a standardized vocabulary, the authors aim to support the logging and querying of policy-related information, thereby enabling organizations to track and audit their compliance with GDPR requirements. The vocabulary includes components for specifying consent, purposes of data processing, and data recipients, among others.

The structure of the paper includes an introduction to the GDPR requirements, a detailed description of the SPECIAL Policy Log Vocabulary, and examples of how the vocabulary can be used to encode policy information. The paper also discusses the benefits of using Semantic Web technologies for this purpose and provides use cases to illustrate the application of the vocabulary in real-world scenarios.

## Approach Contribution For The Compliance Questions

### Question 63

The SPECIAL Policy Log Vocabulary can contribute to answering Question 63 by using components such as `DataTransfer`, `ProcessingActivity`, and `Recipient`. These components allow for the documentation of the nature of the data, the purpose of the processing, the countries involved in the data transfer, and the recipients of the data. By querying the vocabulary, organizations can generate reports that list all transfers and provide the necessary details to comply with this question.

### Question 64

For Question 64, the vocabulary includes components such as `LegalBasis` and `TransferMechanism`. These components can be used to document the legal basis for data transfers, such as EU Commission adequacy decisions or standard contractual clauses. By maintaining records of these legal bases, organizations can demonstrate compliance with GDPR requirements related to data transfers.

## Approach Insufficiencies For Fulfill The Compliance Questions

### Question 8

The SPECIAL Policy Log Vocabulary does not explicitly include components for specifying retention periods for different categories of personal data. While it provides mechanisms for documenting data processing activities and consent, it lacks a dedicated component for retention policies, which is necessary to fully answer this question.

### Question 28

Although the vocabulary supports the documentation of consent and data processing activities, it does not explicitly address procedures for ensuring data accuracy and timely corrections. Additional components or extensions would be needed to track data quality and correction procedures.

### Question 29

Similar to Question 8, the vocabulary does not have specific components for retention policies and procedures. While it can log data processing activities and their purposes, it does not provide a means to enforce or document retention schedules.

### Question 51

The vocabulary lacks components for documenting the destruction, erasure, or anonymization of personal data. It focuses more on logging consent and processing activities rather than data lifecycle management, which is crucial for answering this question.

## Key Contributions

- Introduction of the SPECIAL Policy Log Vocabulary
  - `DataTransfer`
  - `ProcessingActivity`
  - `Recipient`
  - `LegalBasis`
  - `TransferMechanism`
- Use of Semantic Web technologies to ensure interoperability and machine-readability
- Support for logging and querying policy information related to GDPR compliance
- Facilitation of accountability and transparency in data processing activities

## State-of-the-Art

The SPECIAL Policy Log Vocabulary advances the state-of-the-art by providing a standardized, machine-readable way to document and manage data processing policies. This approach leverages Semantic Web technologies, which are particularly well-suited for representing complex policy information in a structured and interoperable manner. The vocabulary supports the logging of consent, data processing activities, and data transfers, enabling organizations to more easily demonstrate compliance with GDPR requirements.

Related work includes other vocabularies and frameworks designed for privacy and data protection, such as the Data Privacy Vocabulary (DPV) and the GDPR Provenance Vocabulary (GDPRov). However, the SPECIAL Policy Log Vocabulary distinguishes itself by focusing on the systematic logging of policy-related information, which is essential for auditing and compliance purposes. While it addresses many aspects of GDPR compliance, it does not fully cover all requirements, highlighting the need for continued development and integration with other vocabularies and technologies.

Overall, the SPECIAL Policy Log Vocabulary represents a significant step forward in the management of data protection policies, offering a robust tool for organizations striving to meet GDPR obligations.
