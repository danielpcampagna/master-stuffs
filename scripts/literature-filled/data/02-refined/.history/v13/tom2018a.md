# Tom, J., Sing, E., & Matulevičius, R. Conceptual Representation of the GDPR: Model and Application Directions. 2018.

## Approach and Motivations

The paper by Tom, Sing, and Matulevičius introduces a conceptual model designed to represent the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requirements. The motivation behind this work is to assist organizations in ensuring compliance with GDPR by providing a structured approach to understanding and implementing its provisions. The authors aim to bridge the gap between legal texts and practical implementation by creating a model that can be used to guide the development of compliance tools and systems.

The approach involves the creation of a model that encapsulates the key elements of the GDPR, including the roles of data subjects, data controllers, and data processors, as well as the various types of data processing activities. The model is built to be versatile and applicable across different business contexts, providing a foundation for organizations to develop their compliance strategies.

The paper is structured to first introduce the GDPR and its significance, followed by a detailed explanation of the conceptual model. The authors then discuss the application directions of the model, including how it can be used to develop compliance tools, guide audits, and support training and education efforts within organizations.

## Approach Contribution For The Compliance Questions

### Question 8

The model includes components that address data retention policies, which can be related to Question 8. Specifically, the `DataRetentionPolicy` component within the model can be used to document the retention periods for various categories of personal data.

### Question 28

The model also encompasses mechanisms for data accuracy and updates. The `DataAccuracy` component can be applied to ensure that procedures are in place for keeping personal data up to date and accurate, addressing Question 28.

### Question 29

Similar to Question 8, the `DataRetentionPolicy` component within the model can be utilized to ensure that data are retained no longer than necessary, thus contributing to answering Question 29.

### Question 51

The model includes provisions for data destruction and anonymization through the `DataDestructionPolicy` component, which can help in systematically managing personal data when it is no longer legally required, addressing Question 51.

### Question 63

The model can track data transfers using the `DataTransferRecord` component, which includes details about the nature of the data, the purpose of processing, and the involved countries and recipients, thus contributing to answering Question 63.

### Question 64

The legal basis for data transfers can be documented using the `LegalBasis` component within the model. This component ensures that the required legal bases for transfers, such as EU Commission adequacy decisions or standard contractual clauses, are well-documented, addressing Question 64.

## Approach Insufficiencies For Fulfill The Compliance Questions

### Question 8

While the `DataRetentionPolicy` component can document retention periods, the model does not provide specific mechanisms for enforcing these policies or automating the data deletion process when retention periods expire.

### Question 28

Although the `DataAccuracy` component addresses data accuracy, the model lacks automated tools or processes to ensure that corrections are made without delay, relying instead on manual updates.

### Question 29

The model’s `DataRetentionPolicy` component does not include automated enforcement mechanisms to govern the deletion of data once the retention period has lapsed, potentially requiring additional tools or systems for full compliance.

### Question 51

The `DataDestructionPolicy` component provides a framework for data destruction, but it does not offer automated solutions for systematically erasing or anonymizing data, necessitating manual intervention or external tools.

### Question 63

While the `DataTransferRecord` component can document data transfers, the model does not include features to ensure compliance with transfer regulations or to automate the tracking of such transfers.

### Question 64

The `LegalBasis` component documents the legal bases for transfers but does not provide mechanisms for verifying the validity of these bases or ensuring they are up to date with the latest legal requirements.

## Key Contributions

- A structured conceptual model representing key GDPR elements
  - `DataRetentionPolicy`
  - `DataAccuracy`
  - `DataDestructionPolicy`
  - `DataTransferRecord`
  - `LegalBasis`
- Aiding organizations in developing GDPR compliance strategies
- Providing a foundation for compliance tools, audits, and training
- Bridging the gap between legal requirements and practical implementation

## State-of-the-Art

This approach advances the state-of-the-art by offering a comprehensive and structured model that encapsulates the essential elements of GDPR. It provides a clear framework that organizations can use to understand and implement GDPR compliance measures. Compared to existing piecemeal approaches, this model offers a more holistic view of GDPR requirements and their interrelationships.

The proposed model competes with other compliance frameworks by offering a detailed representation of GDPR elements, potentially leading to more effective and efficient compliance tools. However, it requires further development in terms of automation and enforcement mechanisms to fully meet all compliance requirements.
