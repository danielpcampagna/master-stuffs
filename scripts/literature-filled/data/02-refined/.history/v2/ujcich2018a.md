Title: A Provenance Model for the European Union General Data Protection Regulation

Problem Addressed:
The paper addresses the problem of interpreting and enforcing the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It highlights the complexity in understanding the GDPR's data processing principles and the difficulties in proving compliance with this regulation.

Methodology Used:
The authors developed a provenance model that structures GDPR's data processing principles. They used the Unified Modeling Language (UML) to design this model, which presents GDPR's data processing activities, entities involved, and the relationships among these entities.

Key Contributions:

- Proposition of a provenance model to understand and enforce GDPR's data processing principles.
- Application of the provenance model in a case study to demonstrate its effectiveness.
- Identification of the challenges in GDPR compliance and how the model can help overcome these challenges.

Related Work:
The related works revolve around the GDPR compliance and enforcement, data privacy and protection, and the development of provenance models for effective data management. Examples include works on provenance models for privacy protection, GDPR compliance tools, and data flow tracking for compliance verification.

Evaluation:
The authors evaluated their model by applying it to a case study. They demonstrated how the model can be used to structure and analyze the data processing activities in a real-world scenario. The results showed that their model can effectively represent GDPR's data processing principles and help identify potential compliance issues.

Future Work:
The authors recommend future work on enhancing the provenance model by incorporating more detailed aspects of the GDPR. They also suggest conducting more case studies in different contexts to validate the model's applicability and effectiveness. In addition, they propose the development of automated tools based on the model to facilitate GDPR compliance and enforcement.

The Proposed Model:
The authors proposed a provenance model for the GDPR. It was built upon the Unified Modeling Language (UML) technology. The model structures the GDPR's data processing principles in terms of the activities, entities involved, and their relationships. It provides a clear and systematic way to understand and enforce the GDPR, thereby facilitating compliance with this regulation.
