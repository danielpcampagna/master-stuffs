# Pandit, Harshvardhan Jitendra, 2020. Representing Activities associated with Processing of Personal Data and Consent using Semantic Web for GDPR Compliance

## Problem Description

The publication addresses the challenge of ensuring compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) by representing activities associated with the processing of personal data and consent using Semantic Web technologies. GDPR compliance requires organizations to manage and document data processing activities and consent in a transparent and accountable manner, which can be complex and resource-intensive.

## Approach Description

The approach utilized in this publication involves the use of Semantic Web technologies to create a structured and machine-readable representation of data processing activities and consent. Specifically, the author employs RDF (Resource Description Framework) and OWL (Web Ontology Language) to model these activities. The publication introduces an ontology named "GDPRov" to capture the necessary details for GDPR compliance.

### Technologies Used:
- RDF (Resource Description Framework)
- OWL (Web Ontology Language)
- PROV (Provenance Ontology)

## Methodology Description

The methodology involves the following steps:
1. **Requirement Analysis**: Identifying the requirements for representing data processing activities and consent as per GDPR.
2. **Ontology Design**: Developing the GDPRov ontology to model these requirements.
3. **Implementation**: Using RDF and OWL to implement the ontology.
4. **Validation**: Ensuring the ontology accurately represents the required information and can be used effectively for compliance purposes.

## Key Contributions

- Introduction of the GDPRov ontology for representing data processing activities and consent.
- Detailed modeling of GDPR compliance requirements using Semantic Web technologies.
- Demonstration of how the ontology can be used to ensure transparency and accountability in data processing.

## Advancements Over State-of-the-Art

The GDPRov ontology advances the state-of-the-art by providing a comprehensive and structured way to represent GDPR compliance information. It leverages Semantic Web technologies to make the data machine-readable, facilitating automated compliance checking and reporting.

## Evaluation of Contribution

The contribution was evaluated through a series of use cases demonstrating how the GDPRov ontology can be applied to real-world scenarios. The evaluation focused on the ontology's ability to capture all necessary details for GDPR compliance and its usability in different contexts.

## Discussion of Results

The results indicate that the GDPRov ontology effectively captures the required information for GDPR compliance and can be used to automate compliance processes. The ontology's use of Semantic Web technologies ensures that the data is interoperable and can be easily integrated with other systems.

## Future Work and Open Issues

Future work includes:
- Extending the GDPRov ontology to cover additional aspects of GDPR compliance.
- Developing tools and applications that leverage the ontology for automated compliance checking.
- Addressing any limitations identified during the evaluation, such as scalability and performance issues.

Open issues include:
- Ensuring widespread adoption and standardization of the ontology.
- Integrating the ontology with existing compliance management systems.
