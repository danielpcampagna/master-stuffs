# Ryan, Paul and Pandit, Harshvardhan J and Brennan, Rob, 2021. Building a Data Processing Activities Catalog: Representing Heterogeneous Compliance-Related Information for GDPR Using DCAT-AP and DPV.

## Problem Description

The publication addresses the challenge of representing and managing heterogeneous compliance-related information for the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Specifically, it focuses on creating a catalog of data processing activities that can help organizations ensure compliance with GDPR requirements.

## Approach Description

The approach utilizes the Data Catalog Vocabulary Application Profile (DCAT-AP) and the Data Privacy Vocabulary (DPV) to represent compliance-related information. DCAT-AP is a specification designed to facilitate interoperability between data catalogs published on the web, while DPV provides a vocabulary for expressing information about data processing and privacy.

## Methodology Description

The methodology involves:
- Extending DCAT-AP to include GDPR-specific requirements.
- Utilizing DPV to annotate data processing activities with relevant compliance information.
- Creating a catalog that integrates these extended vocabularies to provide a comprehensive view of data processing activities.

## Key Contributions

- Development of a catalog that integrates DCAT-AP and DPV for GDPR compliance.
- Extension of DCAT-AP to include GDPR-specific requirements.
- Demonstration of how heterogeneous compliance-related information can be represented and managed using standardized vocabularies.

## Advancements in State-of-the-Art

The current model advances the state-of-the-art by providing a structured and interoperable way to represent and manage GDPR compliance information. It leverages existing standards (DCAT-AP and DPV) and extends them to meet the specific needs of GDPR, thus facilitating better compliance management.

## Evaluation of Contribution

The contribution was evaluated through a case study that demonstrated the practical application of the developed catalog in representing and managing GDPR compliance information. The case study highlighted the effectiveness of the approach in providing a comprehensive and interoperable view of data processing activities.

## Discussion of Results

The results indicate that the developed catalog successfully integrates heterogeneous compliance-related information and provides a structured way to manage GDPR compliance. The use of standardized vocabularies ensures interoperability and facilitates easier compliance management.

## Future Work and Open Issues

Future work includes:
- Further refinement and extension of the catalog to cover additional GDPR requirements.
- Evaluation of the catalog in different organizational contexts to ensure its generalizability.
- Development of tools and interfaces to facilitate the use of the catalog by non-technical users.
- Investigation of the integration of the catalog with other compliance management systems.
