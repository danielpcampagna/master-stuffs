# Bonatti, Piero A and Kirrane, Sabrina and Petrova, Iliana M and Sauro, Luigi, 2020. Machine understandable policies and GDPR compliance checking

## Problem Description

The publication addresses the challenge of ensuring that data processing activities comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It focuses on the need for machine-understandable policies to automate the compliance checking process, which is crucial for organizations to manage and protect personal data effectively.

## Approach Description

The authors propose an approach that leverages semantic web technologies to create machine-understandable policies. This involves using ontologies and rule-based systems to represent and reason about GDPR requirements and data processing activities. The technologies used include:

- **Ontology**: To model GDPR concepts and relationships.
- **RDF (Resource Description Framework)**: For representing data and metadata.
- **SPARQL**: For querying RDF data.
- **Rule-based systems**: For defining and enforcing compliance rules.

## Methodology Description

The methodology involves the following steps:

1. **Ontology Development**: Creating an ontology that captures the key concepts and relationships defined in the GDPR.
2. **Policy Representation**: Defining policies in a machine-readable format using the developed ontology.
3. **Compliance Checking**: Implementing a rule-based system to automatically check if data processing activities comply with the defined policies.

## Key Contributions

- **Ontology for GDPR**: The development of an ontology that models GDPR concepts.
- **Automated Compliance Checking**: A system that automates the process of checking compliance with GDPR.
- **Policy Representation**: A method for representing policies in a machine-understandable format.

## How the Current Model Advances the State-of-the-Art

The proposed model advances the state-of-the-art by providing a structured and automated approach to GDPR compliance checking. It reduces the manual effort required for compliance and ensures more consistent and accurate adherence to GDPR requirements.

## Evaluation of the Contribution

The contribution was evaluated through a series of case studies and experiments that demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach in real-world scenarios. The evaluation focused on the accuracy and efficiency of the compliance checking process.

## Discussion about the Results

The results showed that the proposed approach could accurately and efficiently check compliance with GDPR requirements. The use of semantic web technologies enabled the system to handle complex policies and data processing activities effectively.

## Future Work and Open Issues

Future work includes:

- **Scalability**: Improving the scalability of the system to handle larger datasets and more complex policies.
- **User Interface**: Developing user-friendly interfaces for policy definition and compliance checking.
- **Integration**: Integrating the system with existing data management and processing tools to provide a seamless compliance checking process.

Open issues include addressing the dynamic nature of GDPR regulations and ensuring that the system can adapt to changes in the legal framework.
