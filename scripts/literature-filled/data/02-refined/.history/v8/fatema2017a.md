# Fatema, Kaniz and Hadziselimovic, Ensar and Pandit, Harshvardhan J and Debruyne, Christophe and Lewis, Dave and O'Sullivan, Declan, 2017. Compliance through Informed Consent: Semantic Based Consent Permission and Data Management Model

## Problem Description

The publication addresses the problem of ensuring compliance with data protection regulations through informed consent. Specifically, it focuses on managing consent permissions and data in a way that aligns with legal requirements and user expectations.

## Approach Description

The approach utilizes semantic technologies to create a model for managing consent permissions and data. The technologies used include:

- Ontology: To represent consent and data management concepts.
- RDF (Resource Description Framework): For data representation.
- SPARQL: For querying the data.

The model introduced in the paper is called the **Consent Permission and Data Management Model**.

## Methodology Description

The methodology involves the following steps:

1. **Ontology Development**: Creating an ontology to represent consent permissions and data management.
2. **Data Representation**: Using RDF to represent data in a structured format.
3. **Querying and Compliance Checking**: Utilizing SPARQL to query the data and check for compliance with consent permissions.

## Key Contributions

- Introduction of a semantic-based model for managing consent permissions and data.
- Development of an ontology to represent consent-related concepts.
- Use of RDF and SPARQL for data representation and querying.
- A framework for ensuring compliance with data protection regulations.

## How the Current Model Advances the State-of-the-Art

The model advances the state-of-the-art by providing a structured and semantic approach to managing consent permissions and data. This ensures that data management practices are transparent, compliant with regulations, and aligned with user expectations.

## Evaluation of the Contribution

The contribution was evaluated through a series of use cases and scenarios that demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the model in real-world settings. The evaluation focused on the model's ability to manage consent permissions and ensure compliance with data protection regulations.

## Discussion About the Results

The results indicate that the proposed model is effective in managing consent permissions and ensuring compliance with data protection regulations. The use of semantic technologies provides a flexible and scalable solution for data management.

## Future Work and Open Issues

Future work includes:

- Extending the ontology to cover more consent-related concepts.
- Integrating the model with existing data management systems.
- Conducting more extensive evaluations in different contexts and scenarios.
- Addressing scalability and performance issues in large-scale deployments.

Open issues include:

- Ensuring interoperability with other data management frameworks.
- Addressing privacy concerns related to the use of semantic technologies.
- Enhancing the usability of the model for non-technical users.
