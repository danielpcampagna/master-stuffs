# Campagna, Daniel Prett and da Silva, Altigran Soares and Braganholo, Vanessa, 2020. Achieving GDPR Compliance through Provenance: An Extended Model

## Problem Description

The publication addresses the challenge of achieving compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) using data provenance. GDPR compliance requires organizations to ensure transparency, accountability, and data subject rights, which can be complex and resource-intensive. The paper proposes an extended model to facilitate GDPR compliance through the use of provenance information.

## Approach Description

The approach utilizes data provenance to track and manage personal data throughout its lifecycle. The extended model incorporates technologies such as PROV (Provenance Ontology) and RDF (Resource Description Framework) to represent and query provenance information. The model aims to provide a comprehensive view of data processing activities, ensuring that all GDPR requirements are met.

## Methodology Description

The methodology involves extending existing provenance models to capture additional information required for GDPR compliance. This includes:

- Identifying GDPR-specific requirements.
- Extending the PROV model to include GDPR-related attributes and relationships.
- Implementing the extended model using RDF to enable querying and validation of compliance.

## Key Contributions

- **Extended Provenance Model**: An enhanced provenance model that includes GDPR-specific attributes.
- **Compliance Framework**: A framework for using provenance information to ensure GDPR compliance.
- **Implementation and Validation**: Demonstration of the model's implementation and validation through case studies.

## How the Current Model Advances the State-of-the-Art

The extended model advances the state-of-the-art by integrating GDPR-specific requirements into the provenance framework, providing a more comprehensive solution for compliance. It leverages existing technologies like PROV and RDF to create a robust and queryable model that can be used to track and manage personal data in compliance with GDPR.

## Evaluation of the Contribution

The contribution was evaluated through case studies that demonstrate the model's ability to capture and query GDPR-relevant information. These case studies show how the extended model can be used to ensure compliance in real-world scenarios.

## Discussion About the Results

The results indicate that the extended provenance model is effective in capturing the necessary information for GDPR compliance. The case studies validate the model's applicability and usefulness in real-world settings, highlighting its potential to simplify and automate compliance processes.

## Future Work and Open Issues

Future work includes:

- Extending the model to cover additional regulations beyond GDPR.
- Improving the scalability and performance of the implementation.
- Developing user-friendly tools for non-technical stakeholders to interact with the provenance information.
- Addressing open issues related to data privacy and security in the context of provenance information.
