# Pandit, Harshvardhan J and Oâ€™Sullivan, Declan and Lewis, Dave, 2018. GDPR-driven Change Detection in Consent and Activity Metadata

## Problem Description

The publication addresses the challenge of ensuring compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) by detecting changes in consent and activity metadata. GDPR mandates strict regulations on how personal data is collected, processed, and stored, requiring organizations to maintain accurate records of consent and activities related to personal data.

## Approach Description

The approach utilizes technologies such as Ontology and RDF to model and detect changes in consent and activity metadata. The authors introduce a model/ontology specifically designed to capture the nuances of GDPR compliance.

## Model/Ontology Description

The publication introduces the **GDPRov** ontology. The main components of the GDPRov ontology include:

- **Consent**: Captures the details of consent given by data subjects.
- **Activity**: Records activities performed on personal data.
- **Data Subject**: Represents the individual whose data is being processed.
- **Data Controller**: Represents the entity responsible for data processing.
- **Processing**: Details the specific operations performed on the data.

The GDPRov ontology is publicly available at: [GDPRov Ontology](https://w3id.org/GDPRov)

## Methodology Description

The methodology involves:

1. Defining the GDPRov ontology to model consent and activity metadata.
2. Implementing change detection mechanisms using RDF and SPARQL queries.
3. Evaluating the approach through case studies and scenarios to validate its effectiveness.

## Key Contributions

- Introduction of the GDPRov ontology to model GDPR compliance-related metadata.
- Development of change detection mechanisms for consent and activity metadata.
- Providing a framework to ensure ongoing GDPR compliance through automated monitoring.

## Advancement of State-of-the-Art

The current model advances the state-of-the-art by providing a structured and automated way to detect changes in consent and activity metadata, ensuring continuous GDPR compliance. It leverages semantic web technologies to create a robust and flexible framework for managing GDPR-related data.

## Evaluation of Contribution

The contribution was evaluated through case studies and scenarios that simulate real-world GDPR compliance requirements. The effectiveness of the change detection mechanisms was assessed by their ability to accurately identify and report changes in consent and activity metadata.

## Discussion of Results

The results demonstrated that the GDPRov ontology and the associated change detection mechanisms are effective in identifying changes in consent and activity metadata. This ensures that organizations can maintain compliance with GDPR requirements in a dynamic data processing environment.

## Future Work and Open Issues

Future work includes:

- Extending the GDPRov ontology to cover additional aspects of GDPR compliance.
- Enhancing the change detection mechanisms to handle more complex scenarios.
- Integrating the framework with existing data management systems for broader applicability.
- Addressing scalability issues to handle large volumes of data efficiently.

Open issues include the need for further validation in diverse real-world environments and the potential integration with other regulatory compliance frameworks.
