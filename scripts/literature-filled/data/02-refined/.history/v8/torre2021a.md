# Torre, Damiano and Alferez, Mauricio and Soltana, Ghanem and Sabetzadeh, Mehrdad and Briand, Lionel, 2021. Modeling data protection and privacy: application and experience with GDPR

## Problem Description

The publication addresses the problem of ensuring compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in software systems. GDPR imposes strict requirements on how personal data should be handled, and organizations need systematic approaches to model and verify compliance with these regulations.

## Approach Description

The authors propose a model-driven approach to represent and analyze GDPR requirements. The approach utilizes several technologies, including:

- **Ontology**: To represent GDPR concepts and relationships.
- **UML (Unified Modeling Language)**: For modeling system requirements and data flows.
- **PROV (Provenance Ontology)**: To track data lineage and ensure compliance with data handling requirements.
- **RDF (Resource Description Framework)**: For semantic representation of data and privacy rules.

The approach introduces a comprehensive model that integrates these technologies to facilitate the understanding and verification of GDPR compliance.

## Methodology Description

The methodology involves the following steps:

1. **Requirement Elicitation**: Identifying GDPR requirements relevant to the system.
2. **Modeling**: Using UML to create models of the system's data flows and processes.
3. **Ontology Development**: Creating an ontology to represent GDPR concepts and their relationships.
4. **Compliance Verification**: Using the developed models and ontologies to verify that the system meets GDPR requirements.

## Key Contributions

- A comprehensive model-driven approach for GDPR compliance.
- Integration of multiple technologies (Ontology, UML, PROV, RDF) for effective modeling and analysis.
- A case study demonstrating the application of the approach in a real-world scenario.

## How the Current Model Advances the State-of-the-Art

The proposed model advances the state-of-the-art by providing a systematic and integrated approach to model and verify GDPR compliance. It leverages multiple technologies to offer a more comprehensive and accurate representation of data protection and privacy requirements.

## Evaluation of the Contribution

The contribution was evaluated through a case study involving a real-world system. The case study demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach in identifying and addressing GDPR compliance issues.

## Discussion About the Results

The results of the case study showed that the proposed approach could effectively model and verify GDPR compliance. The integration of different technologies provided a robust framework for understanding and ensuring data protection and privacy.

## Future Work and Open Issues

Future work includes:

- Extending the approach to cover other privacy regulations beyond GDPR.
- Improving the scalability of the approach for larger and more complex systems.
- Enhancing the automation of compliance verification processes.

Open issues include the need for more comprehensive tool support and the challenge of keeping the models up-to-date with evolving regulations.
