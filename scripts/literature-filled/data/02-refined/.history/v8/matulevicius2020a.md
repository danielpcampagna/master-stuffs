# Matulevicius, Raimundas and Tom, Jake and Kala, Kaspar and Sing, Eduard, 2020. A Method for Managing GDPR Compliance in Business Processes

## Problem Description

The publication addresses the challenge of ensuring General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliance within business processes. GDPR imposes stringent requirements on how personal data should be handled, and non-compliance can result in severe penalties. The paper aims to provide a structured method to integrate GDPR compliance into business processes effectively.

## Approach Description

The approach utilizes a combination of modeling techniques and compliance-checking mechanisms. Key technologies and methodologies employed include:

- **Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN)**: Used for modeling business processes.
- **Ontology**: To represent GDPR concepts and requirements.
- **Compliance Rules**: Defined to check against the business process models.

The method involves creating a compliance-aware business process model that integrates GDPR requirements directly into the process design.

## Methodology Description

The methodology consists of several steps:

1. **Identification of GDPR Requirements**: Extracting relevant GDPR articles and translating them into compliance rules.
2. **Modeling Business Processes**: Using BPMN to create detailed models of business processes.
3. **Mapping GDPR Requirements to Business Processes**: Aligning GDPR compliance rules with specific elements of the business process models.
4. **Compliance Checking**: Using automated tools to verify that the business processes comply with the defined GDPR rules.

## Key Contributions

- A structured method for integrating GDPR compliance into business processes.
- A set of compliance rules derived from GDPR articles.
- A framework for mapping GDPR requirements to BPMN models.
- An automated compliance-checking mechanism.

## Advancement of the State-of-the-Art

The proposed method advances the state-of-the-art by providing a systematic approach to embed GDPR compliance into business process models. It bridges the gap between legal requirements and practical implementation within business workflows.

## Evaluation of the Contribution

The contribution was evaluated through a case study in which a business process was modeled and checked for GDPR compliance using the proposed method. The evaluation demonstrated the method's effectiveness in identifying non-compliant elements and suggesting necessary adjustments.

## Discussion of Results

The results indicate that the method can successfully identify compliance issues and guide the redesign of business processes to meet GDPR requirements. The automated compliance-checking tool proved to be efficient in validating complex business process models.

## Future Work and Open Issues

Future work includes:

- Extending the method to cover other regulatory requirements beyond GDPR.
- Improving the automated compliance-checking tool to handle more complex scenarios.
- Conducting more extensive case studies across different industries to validate the method's applicability and robustness.
- Addressing the dynamic nature of regulatory requirements and ensuring the method can adapt to changes over time.
