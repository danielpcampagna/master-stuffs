# Bartolini, Cesare and Muthuri, Robert and Santos, Cristiana, 2015. Using ontologies to model data protection requirements in workflows

## Problem Description

The publication addresses the challenge of incorporating data protection requirements into workflows. Specifically, it focuses on ensuring that workflows comply with data protection regulations by modeling these requirements using ontologies.

## Approach Description

The authors utilize ontologies to represent data protection requirements within workflows. Ontologies are leveraged to provide a structured and formal representation of the knowledge domain, which includes data protection laws and regulations. The technologies used in this approach include:

- **Ontology**: For representing data protection requirements.
- **Workflow**: For modeling the sequence of tasks and processes that handle personal data.

## Methodology Description

The methodology involves the following steps:

1. **Identification of Data Protection Requirements**: Extracting relevant data protection requirements from legal texts.
2. **Ontology Development**: Creating an ontology that encapsulates these requirements.
3. **Workflow Integration**: Integrating the ontology with workflow models to ensure compliance.

## Key Contributions

- **Ontology for Data Protection**: Introduction of an ontology specifically designed to model data protection requirements.
- **Compliance Checking**: A method to check workflow compliance with data protection regulations using the developed ontology.
- **Integration Framework**: A framework that integrates the ontology with existing workflow systems.

## How the Current Model Advances the State-of-the-Art

The model advances the state-of-the-art by providing a formalized and structured way to incorporate data protection requirements into workflows. This ensures that workflows are compliant with data protection laws, which is crucial for organizations handling personal data.

## Evaluation of the Contribution

The contribution was evaluated through case studies where the ontology was applied to real-world workflows. The evaluation demonstrated that the ontology could effectively identify compliance issues and suggest modifications to ensure compliance.

## Discussion of the Results

The results showed that the ontology-based approach could successfully model data protection requirements and integrate them into workflows. This integration helps organizations to automate compliance checking and reduce the risk of data protection violations.

## Future Work and Open Issues

Future work includes:

- **Expansion of the Ontology**: Extending the ontology to cover more comprehensive data protection regulations from different jurisdictions.
- **Tool Development**: Developing tools to automate the integration of the ontology with various workflow management systems.
- **Performance Optimization**: Improving the performance of the compliance checking process to handle large and complex workflows.

The ontology developed in this publication is not explicitly named in the summary provided, and there is no direct link to where the ontology is publicly available. However, the key components of the ontology would typically include entities representing data subjects, data controllers, data processors, types of personal data, and specific data protection requirements.
