# Kirrane, Sabrina and Fern√°ndez, Javier D and Dullaert, Wouter and Milosevic, Uros and Polleres, Axel and Bonatti, Piero A and Wenning, Rigo and Drozd, Olha and Raschke, Philip, 2018. A scalable consent, transparency and compliance architecture

## Problem Description

The publication addresses the challenge of managing user consent, ensuring transparency, and maintaining compliance with data protection regulations in large-scale data processing environments. This is particularly relevant in the context of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which imposes stringent requirements on how personal data should be handled.

## Approach Description

The authors propose a scalable architecture that leverages semantic web technologies to manage consent, transparency, and compliance. The approach utilizes:

- **Ontology**: To model consent and data processing activities.
- **RDF**: For representing data and metadata.
- **PROV**: For capturing provenance information.
- **Workflow**: To manage the sequence of data processing activities.

The architecture is designed to be scalable and capable of integrating with existing data processing systems.

## Methodology Description

The methodology involves the following steps:

1. **Modeling Consent and Data Processing**: Using ontologies to represent consent and data processing activities.
2. **Data Representation**: Employing RDF to represent the data and its metadata.
3. **Provenance Tracking**: Utilizing PROV to capture the provenance of data processing activities.
4. **Workflow Management**: Implementing workflows to manage the sequence and dependencies of data processing activities.
5. **Compliance Checking**: Ensuring that data processing activities comply with the modeled consent and regulatory requirements.

## Key Contributions

- A scalable architecture for managing consent, transparency, and compliance.
- An ontology for modeling consent and data processing activities.
- Integration of semantic web technologies (RDF, PROV) for data representation and provenance tracking.
- A workflow management system for handling data processing activities.

## Advances in State-of-the-Art

The proposed architecture advances the state-of-the-art by providing a scalable solution that integrates semantic web technologies to address the complex requirements of consent management, transparency, and compliance in large-scale data processing environments.

## Evaluation

The contribution was evaluated through a series of use cases and scenarios that demonstrate the effectiveness of the architecture in managing consent, ensuring transparency, and maintaining compliance with GDPR.

## Discussion

The results indicate that the proposed architecture is effective in handling the complexities of consent management, transparency, and compliance. The integration of semantic web technologies provides a flexible and scalable solution that can be adapted to various data processing environments.

## Future Work and Open Issues

Future work includes:

- Extending the ontology to cover more aspects of data processing and consent.
- Improving the scalability and performance of the architecture.
- Developing more comprehensive evaluation scenarios to test the architecture in different contexts.
- Addressing open issues related to the integration of the architecture with existing data processing systems and workflows.
