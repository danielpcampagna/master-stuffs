# Ujcich, Benjamin E., Bates, Adam, and Sanders, William H., 2018. A provenance model for the European union general data protection regulation

## Problem Description

The publication addresses the challenge of ensuring compliance with the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Specifically, it focuses on the need for a robust provenance model that can track and document data processing activities to ensure transparency and accountability as mandated by GDPR.

## Approach Description

The authors propose a provenance model designed to capture and represent data processing activities in a way that aligns with GDPR requirements. The model leverages technologies such as Ontology and PROV (Provenance Data Model) to structure and standardize the representation of data provenance.

## Methodology Description

The methodology involves the design and implementation of a provenance model tailored to GDPR. The authors detail the construction of the model, including the identification of key GDPR requirements and mapping these to provenance data structures. They utilize PROV to ensure that the model can capture the necessary details about data processing activities.

## Key Contributions

- Introduction of a provenance model specifically designed for GDPR compliance.
- Mapping of GDPR requirements to provenance data structures using PROV.
- Demonstration of how the model can be used to document data processing activities.

## How the Current Model Advances the State-of-the-Art

The proposed model advances the state-of-the-art by providing a structured and standardized way to document and track data processing activities in compliance with GDPR. This is crucial for organizations seeking to ensure transparency and accountability in their data handling practices.

## Evaluation of the Contribution

The authors evaluate the model by demonstrating its application in various data processing scenarios. They show how the model can be used to capture and represent the necessary details to ensure GDPR compliance.

## Discussion about the Results

The results indicate that the proposed provenance model is effective in capturing the required details for GDPR compliance. The model provides a clear and structured way to document data processing activities, which can help organizations meet their regulatory obligations.

## Future Work and Open Issues

Future work includes refining the model to cover more specific GDPR requirements and exploring its integration with existing data management systems. Open issues involve ensuring the scalability of the model and its adaptability to different organizational contexts.
