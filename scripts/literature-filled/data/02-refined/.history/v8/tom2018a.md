# Tom, Jake and Sing, Eduard and Matulevicius, Raimundas, 2018. Conceptual representation of the GDPR: model and application directions

## Problem Description

The publication addresses the challenge of understanding and implementing the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in information systems. The GDPR is a complex legal framework that requires organizations to ensure data protection and privacy. The authors aim to provide a conceptual model to represent the GDPR, facilitating its comprehension and application in various domains.

## Approach Description

The authors utilize a conceptual modeling approach to represent the GDPR. They employ technologies such as Ontology and UML (Unified Modeling Language) to create a structured representation of the regulation. The model aims to capture the essential elements of the GDPR and their relationships, making it easier for stakeholders to understand and implement the regulation.

## Methodology Description

The methodology involves the following steps:
1. **Literature Review**: Analyzing existing works on GDPR and conceptual modeling.
2. **Model Development**: Creating a conceptual model using Ontology and UML to represent the GDPR.
3. **Validation**: Ensuring the model accurately represents the GDPR by comparing it with the actual regulation and consulting with domain experts.

## Key Contributions

- **Conceptual Model**: Introduction of a conceptual model to represent the GDPR.
- **Application Directions**: Guidelines on how to apply the model in various domains.
- **Enhanced Understanding**: Improved comprehension of the GDPR for stakeholders.

## How the Current Model Advances the State-of-the-Art

The model advances the state-of-the-art by providing a structured and systematic representation of the GDPR, which was previously lacking. It bridges the gap between legal text and practical implementation, making it easier for organizations to comply with the regulation.

## Evaluation of the Contribution

The contribution was evaluated through validation with domain experts and comparison with the actual GDPR text. The model was found to accurately represent the regulation and was deemed useful by the experts.

## Discussion about the Results

The results indicate that the conceptual model effectively captures the essential elements of the GDPR and their relationships. It provides a clear and structured representation that can be used by various stakeholders to understand and implement the regulation. The model also highlights the complexity of the GDPR and the need for systematic approaches to ensure compliance.

## Future Work and Open Issues

Future work includes:
- **Refinement of the Model**: Continuously updating and refining the model based on feedback and changes in the regulation.
- **Tool Development**: Creating tools to automate the application of the model in information systems.
- **Case Studies**: Conducting case studies to further validate the model in real-world scenarios.
- **Integration with Other Frameworks**: Exploring how the model can be integrated with other regulatory and compliance frameworks.

Open issues include the need for ongoing updates to the model as the GDPR evolves and the challenge of ensuring the model's applicability across different domains and contexts.
