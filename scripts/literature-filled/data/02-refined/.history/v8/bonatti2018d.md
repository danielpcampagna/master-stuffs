# Piero Bonatti, Wouter Dullaert, Javier D. Fern√°ndez, Sabrina Kirrane, Milosevic, Axel Polleres, 2018. The SPECIAL Policy Log Vocabulary

## Problem Description

The publication addresses the challenge of ensuring compliance with data protection regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), in the context of data processing activities. Specifically, it focuses on the need for transparent and accountable logging of data processing activities to ensure that they adhere to specified policies and regulations.

## Approach Description

The approach utilized involves the development of a specialized vocabulary for logging data processing activities in a manner that is compliant with data protection regulations. The vocabulary, named the SPECIAL Policy Log Vocabulary, leverages technologies such as RDF (Resource Description Framework) to provide a structured and machine-readable format for logging data processing events.

## Methodology Description

The methodology includes the design and implementation of the SPECIAL Policy Log Vocabulary, which is intended to capture detailed information about data processing activities. This includes the nature of the data processed, the purposes for which it is processed, and the legal basis for processing. The vocabulary is designed to be extensible and interoperable with existing standards and technologies.

## Key Contributions

- Introduction of the SPECIAL Policy Log Vocabulary for logging data processing activities.
- Use of RDF to provide a structured and machine-readable format for logs.
- Ensuring compliance with GDPR by capturing detailed information about data processing activities.
- Extensibility and interoperability with existing standards and technologies.

## How the Current Model Advances the State-of-the-Art

The SPECIAL Policy Log Vocabulary advances the state-of-the-art by providing a standardized way to log data processing activities in compliance with GDPR. This ensures transparency and accountability, which are critical for data protection. The use of RDF allows for interoperability with other systems and standards, facilitating broader adoption and integration.

## Evaluation of the Contribution

The contribution was evaluated through implementation and testing within the context of the SPECIAL project. The vocabulary was used to log data processing activities and ensure compliance with GDPR, demonstrating its practical applicability and effectiveness.

## Discussion about the Results

The results indicate that the SPECIAL Policy Log Vocabulary is effective in capturing detailed information about data processing activities in a structured and machine-readable format. This facilitates compliance with data protection regulations and enhances transparency and accountability.

## Future Work and Open Issues

Future work includes further refinement and extension of the vocabulary to cover additional aspects of data processing and compliance. Open issues include the need for broader adoption and integration with other systems and standards, as well as ongoing updates to keep pace with evolving data protection regulations.
