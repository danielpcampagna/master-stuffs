## Scientific Publication

### Summary

**Title:** A provenance model for the European union general data protection regulation  
**Authors:** Ujcich, Benjamin E and Bates, Adam and Sanders, William H  
**Year:** 2018  
**Place:** IPAW

#### Problem Addressed
The publication addresses the challenge of ensuring compliance with the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) through the use of data provenance. GDPR imposes strict requirements on data handling, including data collection, processing, and sharing. Ensuring compliance requires detailed tracking and documentation of data flows and processing activities, which is where data provenance becomes crucial.

#### Approach Utilized
The authors propose a provenance model specifically designed to meet the requirements of GDPR. The approach involves the use of provenance technologies to track and document data lifecycle events. The model leverages:

- **PROV:** A W3C standard for representing provenance information.
- **Ontology:** To define the relationships and entities involved in data processing.
- **RDF:** For representing the provenance data in a structured and interoperable format.

#### Model/Ontology Introduced
The publication introduces a provenance model tailored for GDPR compliance. The main components of this model include:

- **Data Subject:** The individual whose data is being processed.
- **Data Controller:** The entity that determines the purposes and means of processing personal data.
- **Data Processor:** The entity that processes data on behalf of the data controller.
- **Processing Activity:** The specific actions taken on the data (e.g., collection, storage, sharing).

Unfortunately, the link to the public availability of the model is not provided in the summary.

#### Methodology
The methodology involves designing the provenance model to capture the necessary information for GDPR compliance. This includes defining the entities, relationships, and activities involved in data processing. The model is then implemented using RDF and PROV to ensure interoperability and standardization.

#### Key Contributions
- **Provenance Model:** A specialized model for tracking data provenance in the context of GDPR.
- **Compliance Documentation:** A framework for documenting data processing activities to demonstrate GDPR compliance.
- **Interoperability:** Use of standard technologies (PROV, RDF) to ensure the model can be widely adopted and integrated with existing systems.

#### Advancement of State-of-the-Art
The proposed model advances the state-of-the-art by providing a structured and standardized way to document and track data processing activities in compliance with GDPR. This addresses the need for transparency and accountability in data handling, which is a core requirement of GDPR.

#### Evaluation
The contribution was evaluated through a case study demonstrating how the model can be applied to document data processing activities in a GDPR-compliant manner. The evaluation focuses on the model's ability to capture the necessary information and its interoperability with existing data management systems.

#### Discussion of Results
The results show that the proposed model effectively captures the required provenance information for GDPR compliance. The use of standard technologies ensures that the model can be integrated with existing systems, facilitating its adoption.

#### Future Work and Open Issues
Future work includes refining the model to cover additional GDPR requirements and extending its applicability to other regulatory frameworks. Open issues involve improving the scalability and performance of the model when dealing with large volumes of data and complex processing activities.
