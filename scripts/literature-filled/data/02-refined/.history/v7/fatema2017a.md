## Scientific Publication: Compliance through Informed Consent: Semantic Based Consent Permission and Data Management Model

### Summary

**Publication Details:**
- **Name:** Compliance through Informed Consent: Semantic Based Consent Permission and Data Management Model
- **Authors:** Fatema, Kaniz; Hadziselimovic, Ensar; Pandit, Harshvardhan J; Debruyne, Christophe; Lewis, Dave; O'Sullivan, Declan
- **Year:** 2017
- **Place:** ISWC

### Problem Addressed
The publication addresses the challenge of ensuring compliance with data protection regulations through informed consent. Specifically, it focuses on managing consent permissions and data in a way that aligns with legal requirements and user expectations.

### Approach Utilized
The approach utilizes semantic technologies to create a model that manages consent permissions and data. Technologies used include:
- **Ontology:** To represent consent and data permissions.
- **RDF (Resource Description Framework):** For data representation.
- **SPARQL:** For querying the data.

### Model/Ontology Introduced
The publication introduces a model called **Consent Permission and Data Management (CPDM)**. 

#### Main Components:
1. **Consent:** Captures the consent provided by the data subject.
2. **Permission:** Details the permissions granted by the consent.
3. **Data Management:** Manages the data in accordance with the given permissions.

### Methodology
The methodology involves:
1. Designing the CPDM ontology to represent consent and permissions.
2. Implementing the ontology using RDF.
3. Querying the data using SPARQL to ensure compliance with the consent permissions.

### Key Contributions
- **Semantic Model for Consent:** Introduction of a semantic model to represent and manage consent permissions.
- **Compliance Automation:** Automating the compliance process through semantic technologies.
- **Interoperability:** Ensuring interoperability between different systems handling consent and data.

### Advancements to State-of-the-Art
The CPDM model advances the state-of-the-art by providing a structured and semantic approach to managing consent and data permissions, which is crucial for compliance with data protection regulations.

### Evaluation
The contribution was evaluated through:
- **Case Studies:** Demonstrating the application of the CPDM model in real-world scenarios.
- **Performance Metrics:** Assessing the efficiency and effectiveness of the model in managing consent and permissions.

### Discussion of Results
The results indicate that the CPDM model effectively manages consent and permissions, ensuring compliance with data protection regulations. The semantic approach provides clarity and structure, making it easier to handle complex consent scenarios.

### Future Work and Open Issues
Future work includes:
- **Scalability:** Enhancing the model to handle larger datasets.
- **User Interface:** Developing user-friendly interfaces for managing consent.
- **Integration:** Integrating the model with existing data management systems.
- **Legal Updates:** Continuously updating the model to comply with evolving data protection laws.
