### Classification: Scientific Publication

### Comprehensive Summary

**Publication Details:**
- **Name:** Machine understandable policies and GDPR compliance checking
- **Authors:** Bonatti, Piero A; Kirrane, Sabrina; Petrova, Iliana M; Sauro, Luigi
- **Year:** 2020
- **Volume:** 34
- **Number:** 3
- **Place:** KI

**Problem Addressed:**
The publication addresses the challenge of ensuring compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) through machine-understandable policies. GDPR compliance is a complex and critical issue for organizations handling personal data, and the paper aims to facilitate automated compliance checking.

**Approach Utilized:**
The approach involves the use of semantic technologies to create machine-understandable policies that can be automatically checked for GDPR compliance. Technologies mentioned include:
- **Ontology:** Used to model GDPR concepts and rules.
- **RDF (Resource Description Framework):** Utilized for representing data and metadata.
- **SPARQL:** Employed for querying RDF data.
- **PROV (Provenance Data Model):** Used to track data lineage and processing activities.

**Model/Ontology Introduced:**
The paper introduces an ontology for GDPR compliance checking. While the specific name of the ontology is not provided in the summary, its main components include:
- **Data Subject:** Individuals whose data is being processed.
- **Data Controller:** Entities that determine the purposes and means of processing personal data.
- **Data Processor:** Entities that process data on behalf of the data controller.
- **Processing Activities:** Actions taken on personal data.
- **Legal Bases:** Justifications for data processing under GDPR.
- **Data Transfers:** Movements of data across borders or to third parties.

**Methodology Used:**
The methodology involves:
1. **Ontology Development:** Creating a comprehensive ontology that captures GDPR concepts and rules.
2. **Policy Specification:** Defining machine-understandable policies using the developed ontology.
3. **Compliance Checking:** Implementing automated tools to check policies against GDPR requirements using SPARQL queries.

**Key Contributions:**
- Development of a GDPR ontology that formalizes key concepts and rules.
- Creation of machine-understandable policies for automated compliance checking.
- Implementation of a compliance checking tool using semantic technologies.

**Advancement of State-of-the-Art:**
The model advances the state-of-the-art by providing a structured and automated approach to GDPR compliance checking, reducing the manual effort required and increasing accuracy.

**Evaluation of Contribution:**
The contribution was evaluated through:
- **Case Studies:** Demonstrating the application of the ontology and compliance checking tool in real-world scenarios.
- **Performance Metrics:** Assessing the efficiency and accuracy of the automated compliance checking process.

**Discussion of Results:**
The results indicate that the proposed approach effectively automates GDPR compliance checking, identifying potential compliance issues more quickly and accurately than manual methods. However, the complexity of GDPR and the variability in organizational practices pose challenges.

**Future Work and Open Issues:**
Future work includes:
- **Extending the Ontology:** Incorporating more detailed GDPR provisions and sector-specific regulations.
- **Scalability:** Enhancing the tool to handle large-scale data processing activities.
- **User Interface:** Developing user-friendly interfaces for non-technical users.
- **Interoperability:** Ensuring compatibility with other compliance frameworks and tools.

**Link to Model/Ontology:**
The summary does not provide a direct link to the ontology. However, it is likely available through academic repositories or by contacting the authors.
