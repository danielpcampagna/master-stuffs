## Summary

### The Problem it Addresses
The publication "The SPECIAL Policy Log Vocabulary" addresses the challenge of ensuring compliance with data protection regulations, specifically the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), in the context of data processing activities. The need for transparency and accountability in data processing necessitates a standardized way to log and manage policies related to data usage.

### Approach Utilized
The approach utilized involves the development of a vocabulary to log data processing activities in a manner that is compliant with GDPR. The technologies used in this approach include:

- **RDF (Resource Description Framework)**: For representing information about resources in the web.
- **Ontology**: For defining the structure and semantics of the policy log vocabulary.

### Model/Ontology Introduced
The publication introduces the **SPECIAL Policy Log Vocabulary**. The main components of this vocabulary include:

- **Data Processing Activities**: Representing the actions performed on data.
- **Consent**: Capturing the consent given by data subjects.
- **Purpose**: The reason for which data is processed.
- **Recipients**: Entities to whom data is disclosed.
- **Storage**: Information about where and how data is stored.

Unfortunately, the link to the model is not provided in the publication details.

### Methodology Used
