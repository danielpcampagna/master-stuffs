### Scientific Publication

**Publication Details:**
- **Name:** Conceptual representation of the GDPR: model and application directions
- **Authors:** Tom, Jake; Sing, Eduard; Matulevicius, Raimundas
- **Year:** 2018
- **Place:** BIR

**Summary:**

#### Problem Addressed
The publication addresses the challenge of understanding and implementing the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in a structured and systematic manner. The complexity and legal jargon of GDPR make it difficult for organizations to ensure compliance. The paper aims to provide a conceptual model that can help in representing GDPR requirements clearly and facilitate their application in various domains.

#### Approach Utilized
The authors utilize a combination of Ontology and Unified Modeling Language (UML) to create a conceptual model for GDPR. The approach involves:
- **Ontology:** To define the key concepts and relationships within GDPR.
- **UML:** To visually represent these concepts and their interactions.

#### Model/Ontology Introduced
The paper introduces the "GDPR Conceptual Model." The main components of this model include:
- **Data Subject:** The individual whose personal data is being processed.
- **Data Controller:** The entity that determines the purposes and means of processing personal data.
- **Data Processor:** The entity that processes data on behalf of the data controller.
- **Personal Data:** Any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.
- **Processing Activities:** Operations performed on personal data (e.g., collection, storage, use).

Unfortunately, the link to the public availability of the model is not provided in the summary.

#### Methodology Used
The methodology involves:
1. **Literature Review:** To gather existing knowledge and identify gaps in GDPR representation.
2. **Conceptual Modeling:** Using ontology and UML to create a structured representation of GDPR.
3. **Validation:** Through case studies and expert reviews to ensure the model's accuracy and applicability.

#### Key Contributions
- **A comprehensive conceptual model of GDPR.**
- **A visual representation using UML to facilitate understanding and communication.**
- **Application directions for using the model in various domains.**

#### Advancement of the State-of-the-Art
The current model advances the state-of-the-art by providing a structured and visual representation of GDPR, which simplifies the complex legal text and makes it more accessible for implementation in different organizational contexts.

#### Evaluation of Contribution
The contribution was evaluated through:
- **Case Studies:** To apply the model in real-world scenarios and assess its practical utility.
- **Expert Reviews:** To gather feedback from GDPR experts and refine the model accordingly.

#### Discussion of Results
The results indicate that the conceptual model effectively captures the essential elements of GDPR and provides a useful tool for organizations to understand and implement GDPR requirements. The visual representation using UML was particularly appreciated for its clarity and ease of use.

#### Future Work and Open Issues
- **Extension of the Model:** To cover more detailed aspects of GDPR and other related regulations.
- **Tool Development:** Creating software tools that leverage the conceptual model for automated compliance checking.
- **Broader Validation:** Conducting more extensive case studies across different industries to further validate and refine the model.
