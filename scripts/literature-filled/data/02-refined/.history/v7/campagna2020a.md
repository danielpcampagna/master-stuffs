#### Comprehensive Summary

**Title:** Achieving GDPR Compliance through Provenance: An Extended Model  
**Authors:** Campagna, Daniel Prett and da Silva, Altigran Soares and Braganholo, Vanessa  
**Year:** 2020  
**Place:** SBBD

**Problem Addressed:**
The publication addresses the challenge of achieving compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) through the use of data provenance. GDPR compliance is crucial for organizations that handle personal data of EU citizens, and it requires transparency, accountability, and traceability of data processing activities.

**Approach Utilized:**
The authors propose an extended model that leverages data provenance to ensure GDPR compliance. The technologies used in this approach include:

- **Provenance:** To track the history and lifecycle of data.
- **Ontology:** To provide a structured representation of GDPR-related concepts and relationships.

**Model/Ontology Introduced:**
The publication introduces an extended provenance model tailored for GDPR compliance. The main components of this model include:

- **Data Subject:** The individual whose personal data is being processed.
- **Data Controller:** The entity that determines the purposes and means of processing personal data.
- **Data Processor:** The entity that processes data on behalf of the data controller.
- **Processing Activity:** The operations performed on personal data.
- **Consent:** The permission given by the data subject for data processing.

Unfortunately, the link to the public availability of the model is not provided in the summary.

**Methodology Used:**
The methodology involves extending existing provenance models to incorporate GDPR-specific requirements. This includes defining new entities, relationships, and attributes that capture the necessary information for GDPR compliance.

**Key Contributions:**
- An extended provenance model specifically designed for GDPR compliance.
- A detailed mapping of GDPR requirements to provenance data.
- Demonstration of how the model can be used to ensure transparency and accountability in data processing.

**Advancement of the State-of-the-Art:**
The proposed model advances the state-of-the-art by providing a comprehensive and structured approach to achieving GDPR compliance through provenance. It integrates legal requirements with technical solutions, enabling organizations to maintain detailed records of data processing activities and demonstrate compliance.

**Evaluation of Contribution:**
The contribution was evaluated through a case study that demonstrates the practical application of the extended provenance model in a real-world scenario. The evaluation highlights the model's effectiveness in capturing and managing GDPR-related information.

**Discussion of Results:**
The results indicate that the extended provenance model successfully addresses the key requirements of GDPR, such as data traceability, accountability, and transparency. The model provides a clear and structured way to document data processing activities, which is essential for compliance audits and investigations.

**Future Work and Open Issues:**
Future work includes refining the model based on feedback from practical implementations and exploring the integration of the model with existing data management systems. Open issues include addressing scalability concerns and ensuring the model's adaptability to different organizational contexts and data processing workflows.
