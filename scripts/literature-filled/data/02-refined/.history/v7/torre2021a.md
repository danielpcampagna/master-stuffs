**Problem Addressed:**
The publication addresses the challenge of ensuring compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) through effective modeling of data protection and privacy requirements. GDPR compliance is complex due to its extensive and detailed requirements, and organizations often struggle to interpret and implement these requirements correctly.

**Approach Utilized:**
The authors utilize a model-driven engineering approach to facilitate GDPR compliance. The approach involves the use of various technologies including:

- **Ontology:** To represent GDPR concepts and their relationships.
- **Unified Modeling Language (UML):** For creating visual models that represent data protection requirements.
- **Workflow:** To model the processes and activities that need to comply with GDPR.

**Model/Ontology Introduced:**
The publication introduces a GDPR compliance model. The main components of this model include:

- **Data Subject:** Individuals whose personal data is being processed.
- **Data Controller:** Entity that determines the purposes and means of processing personal data.
- **Data Processor:** Entity that processes data on behalf of the data controller.
- **Processing Activity:** Any operation performed on personal data.
- **Consent:** Legal basis for processing personal data.

**Methodology Used:**
The methodology involves the following steps:

1. **Requirement Elicitation:** Identifying GDPR requirements relevant to the organization.
2. **Modeling:** Using UML to create models that represent these requirements.
3. **Validation:** Ensuring that the models accurately reflect GDPR requirements.
4. **Implementation:** Applying the models to organizational processes and systems.

**Key Contributions:**
- A comprehensive model for representing GDPR requirements.
- A methodology for applying model-driven engineering to GDPR compliance.
- Case studies demonstrating the application of the model in real-world scenarios.

**Advancement of State-of-the-Art:**
The current model advances the state-of-the-art by providing a structured and systematic approach to GDPR compliance. It leverages model-driven engineering to simplify the interpretation and implementation of GDPR requirements, making it easier for organizations to ensure compliance.

**Evaluation of Contribution:**
The contribution was evaluated through case studies in different organizational contexts. These case studies demonstrated the practical applicability and effectiveness of the proposed model in ensuring GDPR compliance.

**Discussion of Results:**
The results from the case studies indicate that the proposed model significantly aids in understanding and implementing GDPR requirements. It helps in identifying compliance gaps and provides a clear roadmap for achieving compliance.

**Future Work and Open Issues:**
Future work includes refining the model to cover more specific GDPR scenarios and extending it to other data protection regulations. Open issues involve addressing the dynamic nature of data protection requirements and ensuring the model remains up-to-date with regulatory changes.
