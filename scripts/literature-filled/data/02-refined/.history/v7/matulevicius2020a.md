### Authors
Matulevicius, Raimundas; Tom, Jake; Kala, Kaspar; Sing, Eduard

### Year
2020

### Place
CAiSE

### Problem Addressed
The publication addresses the challenge of ensuring that business processes comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). GDPR imposes strict requirements on how personal data should be handled, and businesses need effective methods to integrate these requirements into their processes.

### Approach Utilized
The authors propose a method that integrates GDPR compliance into business processes. The approach involves:

- **Ontology**: The use of ontologies to model GDPR requirements and business processes.
- **UML (Unified Modeling Language)**: For visual representation of business processes.
- **RDF (Resource Description Framework)**: To structure and link data related to GDPR compliance.

### Model/Ontology Introduced
The publication introduces a GDPR compliance ontology. The main components of this ontology include:

- **Data Subject**: Individuals whose personal data is being processed.
- **Data Controller**: Entities that determine the purposes and means of processing personal data.
- **Data Processor**: Entities that process personal data on behalf of the data controller.
- **Processing Activity**: Actions performed on personal data.
- **Legal Basis**: Justifications for processing personal data under GDPR.

Unfortunately, the link to the public availability of the model is not provided in the summary.

### Methodology
The methodology involves:
1. **Identifying GDPR Requirements**: Extracting relevant GDPR articles and translating them into compliance requirements.
2. **Modeling Business Processes**: Using UML to represent the business processes.
3. **Mapping GDPR Requirements to Processes**: Using the GDPR compliance ontology to ensure that each business process complies with the identified requirements.
4. **Verification and Validation**: Ensuring that the modeled processes meet GDPR compliance through formal verification techniques.

### Key Contributions
- A comprehensive method for integrating GDPR compliance into business processes.
- Introduction of a GDPR compliance ontology to facilitate the mapping of legal requirements to business processes.
- A structured approach using UML and RDF to model and verify compliance.

### Advancement of State-of-the-Art
The proposed method advances the state-of-the-art by providing a systematic way to ensure GDPR compliance in business processes. It bridges the gap between legal requirements and practical implementation in business workflows.

### Evaluation
The contribution was evaluated through case studies in different business domains. The authors demonstrated the applicability of their method by modeling and verifying compliance in real-world scenarios.

### Discussion of Results
The results showed that the proposed method effectively identified and addressed GDPR compliance issues in business processes. The case studies highlighted the method's flexibility and robustness in different contexts.

### Future Work and Open Issues
Future work includes:
- Extending the ontology to cover more detailed aspects of GDPR.
- Developing automated tools to support the compliance verification process.
- Exploring the integration of the method with other regulatory frameworks beyond GDPR.

### Conclusion
The publication presents a novel method for managing GDPR compliance in business processes, contributing significantly to the field by providing a structured and verifiable approach to integrating legal requirements into business workflows.
