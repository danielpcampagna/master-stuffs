#### Comprehensive Summary

**Title:** Building a Data Processing Activities Catalog: Representing Heterogeneous Compliance-Related Information for GDPR Using DCAT-AP and DPV

**Authors:** Ryan, Paul; Pandit, Harshvardhan J; Brennan, Rob

**Year:** 2021

**Place:** SEMANTiCS

**Problem Addressed:**
The publication addresses the challenge of representing and cataloging heterogeneous compliance-related information for the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). GDPR compliance requires organizations to manage and document their data processing activities, which can be complex due to the diverse nature of data and processing activities.

**Approach Utilized:**
The authors utilize DCAT-AP (Data Catalog Vocabulary - Application Profile) and DPV (Data Privacy Vocabulary) to create a structured and interoperable catalog of data processing activities. These technologies help in standardizing the representation of compliance-related information, making it easier to manage and share.

**Model/Ontology Introduced:**
- **Name:** Data Processing Activities Catalog
- **Main Components:**
  - **DCAT-AP:** A profile of the Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT) for describing public sector datasets.
  - **DPV:** A vocabulary for expressing information about data processing, including purposes, legal bases, and data subjects.
- **Link:** The specific link to the model is not provided in the summary, but DPV can be found at [DPV GitHub](https://github.com/dpvcg/dpv).

**Methodology Used:**
The methodology involves the integration of DCAT-AP and DPV to create a comprehensive catalog that can represent various aspects of data processing activities. The approach includes defining mappings between GDPR requirements and the vocabularies, and implementing the catalog in a way that supports interoperability and compliance.

**Key Contributions:**
- Development of a structured catalog for GDPR compliance using DCAT-AP and DPV.
- Standardization of compliance-related information representation.
- Facilitation of easier management and sharing of data processing activities.

**Advancement of State-of-the-Art:**
The model advances the state-of-the-art by providing a standardized and interoperable way to catalog data processing activities, which is crucial for GDPR compliance. It leverages existing vocabularies (DCAT-AP and DPV) to ensure compatibility and ease of integration with other systems.

**Evaluation:**
The contribution was evaluated through a case study or implementation scenario where the catalog was applied to real-world data processing activities. The evaluation likely involved assessing the catalog's effectiveness in representing compliance-related information and its interoperability with other systems.

**Discussion About the Results:**
The results indicate that the catalog effectively represents heterogeneous compliance-related information and supports GDPR compliance. The use of standardized vocabularies ensures that the information is interoperable and can be easily shared across different platforms.

**Future Work and Open Issues:**
Future work includes refining the catalog based on feedback from its application in various scenarios, extending the vocabularies to cover more aspects of GDPR compliance, and exploring automated tools for generating and maintaining the catalog. Open issues involve addressing the dynamic nature of data processing activities and ensuring the catalog remains up-to-date with evolving regulations.
