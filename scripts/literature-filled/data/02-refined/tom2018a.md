# Tom, J., Sing, E., & Matulevicius, R. Conceptual Representation of the GDPR: Model and Application Directions. 2018.

## Approach and Motivations

This publication presents a conceptual model aimed at representing the GDPR to facilitate compliance for organizations. The approach is driven by the necessity to provide a structured representation of the GDPR to help organizations understand and implement its requirements. The model introduced is grounded in business informatics research, leveraging conceptual modeling techniques to map GDPR requirements into a format that can be more easily understood and applied.

The structure of the paper includes a detailed explanation of the GDPR provisions, the motivation behind creating a conceptual model, and the application directions for the model. The authors underscore the complexity of GDPR compliance and the critical need for tools that can simplify this process for data controllers. The model serves as a bridge between legal texts and practical implementation, aiming to reduce the ambiguity and complexity inherent in the GDPR.

## Approach Contribution For The Compliance Questions

### Question 8
The conceptual model partially addresses data retention by mapping GDPR provisions, but it does not specify retention periods for different categories of personal data. The model helps understand the general rule that data must be retained no longer than necessary, but lacks the specific component (`RetentionPeriod`) to list the exact periods.

### Question 28
Procedures for ensuring data accuracy and timely corrections are not explicitly modeled. While the conceptual model provides a high-level understanding of GDPR requirements, it does not include a specific component (`DataAccuracyProcedure`) to track or enforce these procedures.

### Question 29
Similarly, the model outlines the need for retention policies but does not detail specific procedures. The absence of a dedicated component (`RetentionPolicy`) means that while the model highlights the importance of retention policies, it does not provide a mechanism for their implementation or verification.

### Question 51
The systematic destruction, erasure, or anonymization of data is another area where the model falls short. There is no component (`DataDestructionProcedure`) to ensure these processes are followed when data retention is no longer legally required.

### Question 63
The model does not include a comprehensive listing of data transfers or details about the nature, purpose, source, and recipient of data transfers. A component (`DataTransferList`) is needed but not present in the model to address this requirement fully.

### Question 64
Legal bases for data transfers, such as EU Commission adequacy decisions or standard contractual clauses, are not covered in detail. The model lacks a specific component (`LegalBasisForTransfer`) to document and verify these legal bases.

## Approach Insufficiencies For Fulfill The Compliance Questions

### Question 8
The model lacks the specific `RetentionPeriod` component, which limits its ability to fully specify retention periods for different categories of personal data. This insufficiency makes it challenging for data controllers to use the model for detailed retention planning.

### Question 28
Without a `DataAccuracyProcedure` component, the model cannot ensure that personal data is kept up to date and corrected promptly. This gap indicates that the model does not provide mechanisms for ongoing data accuracy and maintenance.

### Question 29
The absence of a `RetentionPolicy` component means the model does not offer specific procedures to enforce data retention policies. This limitation hinders the ability to ensure data is held only as long as necessary for its intended purpose.

### Question 51
The lack of a `DataDestructionProcedure` component signifies that the model does not cover the systematic destruction, erasure, or anonymization of data. This gap is critical for ensuring compliance with GDPR’s data minimization and retention principles.

### Question 63
The model's inability to list all data transfers and their details is due to the missing `DataTransferList` component. This insufficiency makes it difficult to track and document data transfers comprehensively.

### Question 64
Without the `LegalBasisForTransfer` component, the model does not document legal bases for data transfers, making it incomplete for verifying compliance with GDPR’s data transfer requirements.

## Key Contributions

- Provides a structured conceptual model to represent GDPR requirements.
- Helps bridge the gap between legal text and practical implementation.
- **Components Introduced**:
  - General GDPR Provisions Mapping

## State-of-the-Art

This approach advances the state-of-the-art by offering a structured representation of the GDPR, which is a novel contribution in the field of business informatics. It addresses the complexity of GDPR compliance by providing a conceptual model that can be more easily understood and applied by organizations. 

Related work in this space typically involves legal analyses or technical solutions that do not bridge the gap between legal requirements and practical implementation as effectively. This model offers a unique contribution by focusing on conceptual clarity and practical applicability, making it a valuable tool for data controllers seeking to navigate GDPR compliance.

By comparing it with existing tools and frameworks, this model stands out for its emphasis on a structured, conceptual representation that aligns closely with GDPR provisions. However, its limitations in covering specific compliance questions highlight areas for future improvement and expansion.
