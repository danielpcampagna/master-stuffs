  - Question 8:
      score: 0
      justification: The approach does not specifically address the categorization of personal data and the retention periods required for compliance. The ontology's granularity is too coarse, and it lacks specific provisions to list data retention periods explicitly.
  - Question 28:
      score: 0
      justification: While the ontology helps in understanding obligations, it does not provide a direct mechanism to ensure that personal data is kept up to date and accurately corrected without delay. It lacks procedural components that could automate or enforce these requirements.
  - Question 29:
      score: 0
      justification: The ontology does not include specific retention policies or procedures to ensure data is held no longer than necessary. It focuses more on identifying duties and rights rather than implementing retention strategies.
  - Question 51:

  - Question 8:
      score: 80
      justification: The CDMM incorporates the lifecycle of consent and data, including the retention period, and uses the Provenance component to track this. However, it might not fully cover all possible retention scenarios comprehensively.
  - Question 28:
      score: 70
      justification: The model addresses data corrections and updates through the Processes and Obligations components, but it might lack detailed mechanisms to ensure all data remains up to date across multiple systems in complex environments.
  - Question 29:
      score: 80
      justification: Retention policies are managed using the Permission and Provenance components, ensuring data is held only as long as necessary with a clear audit trail. However, more detailed guidelines and enforcement mechanisms might be needed.
  - Question 51:
      score: 70
      justification: The Obligations component defines rules for data destruction, erasure, or anonymization, and the Provenance component tracks compliance. However, more specific implementation details might be required for consistency across systems.
  - Question 63:
      score: 80
      justification: The Provenance component documents all data transfers, ensuring comprehensive tracking of data flows and compliance with GDPR requirements. However, it might not cover all complexities involved in international data transfers.
  - Question 64:
      score: 80
      justification: The Permission component records the legal basis for data transfers and manages this within the CDMM to demonstrate compliance. Additional components might be needed to ensure correct documentation across different jurisdictions.
