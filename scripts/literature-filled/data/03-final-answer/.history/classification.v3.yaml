  "Question 8":
    score: 100
    justification: The approach documents data processing activities in terms of their temporal period, facilitating the listing of retention periods for each category of personal data using DCAT-AP and DPV.
  
  "Question 28":
    score: 100
    justification: Procedures for ensuring data accuracy and updates can be documented within the catalog, which supports the maintenance of up-to-date and accurate data.

  "Question 29":
    score: 100
    justification: The use of DCAT-AP and DPV supports the documentation of retention policies, ensuring data are held no longer than necessary.

  "Question 51":
    score: 100
    justification: The catalog can include metadata about the lifecycle of data processing activities, including the destruction, erasure, or anonymization of personal data.

  "Question 63":
    score: 0
    justification: The paper does not specify if the catalog can comprehensively list all data transfers, including details such as the nature of the data, processing purposes, and recipient information.

"Pandit, Harshvardhan J, O’Sullivan, Declan, and Lewis, Dave. GDPR-driven Change Detection in Consent and Activity Metadata. 2018":
  "Question 8":
    score: 0
    justification: The approach lacks components to record and query the retention period for each category of personal data. The focus is on consent changes and workflow provenance, not on retention periods.
  "Question 28":
    score: 100
    justification: The approach uses P-Plan to track the provenance of activities, ensuring that personal data is kept up to date and accurate. Corrections are recorded and linked to original activities, ensuring updates are made without delay.
  "Question 29":
    score: 0
    justification: While the approach tracks changes in workflows and consent, it does not provide detailed mechanisms for enforcing retention policies and procedures. Additional components or policies would be needed to fully address this "question".
  "Question 51":
    score: 100
    justification: The approach uses P-Plan to track the provenance of data destruction activities. When personal data is no longer required, the corresponding workflow changes can be recorded and linked to demonstrate compliance with data destruction requirements.
  "Question 63":
    score: 0
    justification: The current model does not cover the detailed tracking of data transfers, including the nature of the data, the purpose of processing, and the recipient information. The focus is primarily on consent changes and activity provenance.
  "Question 64":
    score: 0
    justification: The approach does not address the legal basis for data transfers or the documentation of such bases. Additional components would be required to track and document the legal justifications for data transfers.
