Paragraph 1:

Several studies address data retention periods but have limitations. Ryan et al. [ryan2021a] use semantic metadata with DCAT-AP and DPV to specify retention periods, facilitating listing per data category, but lack mechanisms for comprehensive documentation of data transfers and legal bases. Campagna et al. [campagna2020a] enhance data provenance models with retention duration but lack components for data accuracy and erasure enforcement. Besik and Freytag [besik2019a] introduce the 'Limited Retention Period' principle in the PaCW Ontology to ensure data erasure when unnecessary, yet do not explicitly track data transfers or legal bases. Bonatti et al. [bonatti2020a] encode time limits for data erasure using the SPECIAL policy language but don't provide methods for ensuring data accuracy or systematic data destruction. Fatema et al. [fatema2017a] present the Consent and Data Management Model (CDMM) to track consent and data lifecycles, including retention periods, aiding in listing retention periods but may lack granularity and doesn't fully ensure data is up-to-date across systems. Kirrane et al. [kirrane2018a] use RDF vocabularies in the SPECIAL system to document retention periods per GDPR but do not handle data destruction or anonymization.

Paragraph 2:

Various studies address procedures for ensuring personal data is accurate and up to date but have limitations. Ryan et al. [ryan2021a] use a metadata-based data processing activities catalog, aiding data accuracy but lacking mechanisms for timely corrections. Pandit et al. [pandit2018f] use P-Plan to track provenance, ensuring corrections without delay but focus primarily on consent changes. Ujcich et al. [ujcich2018a] present a provenance model with timestamps and data change tracking, supporting data accuracy but lack mechanisms for ongoing accuracy and prompt corrections. Besik et al. [besik2019a] include a 'Consent Check' in the PaCW Ontology, indirectly supporting data accuracy when consent is updated but don't address data accuracy mechanisms outside consent. Fatema et al. [fatema2017a] propose CDMM focusing on consent and data lifecycle, ensuring timely corrections but may lack mechanisms to keep data up to date across multiple databases in complex environments. Kirrane et al. [kirrane2018a] develop a compliance dashboard recording data processing events, supporting verification of procedures for data accuracy but not handling data destruction or anonymization. While these studies contribute valuable insights, integrating them with comprehensive data quality management systems and enhancing models for continuous data accuracy is needed.

Paragraph 3:

Several studies address retention policies to ensure data is not held longer than necessary but have limitations. Ryan et al. [ryan2021a] use DCAT-AP and DPV to document data processing activities and retention periods, aiding compliance monitoring but may lack granularity for all retention scenarios. Besik and Freytag [besik2019a] incorporate the 'Limited Retention Period' principle in the PaCW Ontology, ensuring data isn't held longer than necessary but lack detailed tracking of data transfers and legal bases. Bonatti et al. [bonatti2020a] use the SPECIAL policy language to encode retention policies per GDPR but don't address systematic data destruction or anonymization. Fatema et al. [fatema2017a] propose CDMM using Permission and Provenance components to manage retention policies, providing an audit trail but may need more detailed guidelines and enforcement mechanisms in complex environments. Kirrane et al. [kirrane2018a] offer a compliance architecture with a usage policy language for retention policies, supporting transparency but not handling data destruction or anonymization. While these studies offer valuable methodologies, none provide a comprehensive solution covering all aspects of ensuring data isn't held longer than necessary, indicating a need for further research.

Paragraph 4:

Studies address whether personal data is systematically destroyed, erased, or anonymized when no longer legally required but have insufficiencies. Ryan et al. [ryan2021a] document the lifecycle of data processing activities, including data destruction, but lack mechanisms for comprehensive listing and enforcement of retention policies. Pandit et al. [pandit2018f] track the provenance of data destruction activities, contributing to compliance demonstration but lack detailed mechanisms for enforcing systematic data destruction. Ujcich et al. [ujcich2018a] maintain records of data destruction actions but don't offer specific procedures for systematic handling when data is no longer necessary. Besik and Freytag [besik2019a] address systematic data destruction through the 'Limited Retention Period' principle in the PaCW Ontology but don't cover detailed tracking and documentation of all data transfers or legal bases. Thus, while these studies offer insights, they require further development and integration of additional processes to fully address systematic data handling when legal requirements lapse.

Paragraph 5:

Studies addressing data transfers have limitations. Ujcich et al. [ujcich2018a] track data transfers, detailing origins and destinations but lack mechanisms to document legal justifications, falling short for international data transfers. Bonatti et al. [bonatti2018d] offer the SPECIAL Policy Log Vocabulary with ProcessingActivity and DataTransfer, capturing data nature and transfer details but lack components for documenting retention periods or ensuring data accuracy and prompt correction. Fatema et al. [fatema2017a] use CDMM's provenance component to document data transfers and manage consent and data lifecycle but may not cover complexities of international transfers or various retention scenarios. Kirrane et al. [kirrane2018a] record data processing and sharing events, aiding in documenting data transfers but don't address data destruction or anonymization, leaving a gap in GDPR compliance related to data transfers.

Paragraph 6:

Studies propose frameworks to document the legal basis for cross-border data transfers under GDPR but have limitations. Bonatti et al. [bonatti2018d] introduce the LegalBasis component in the SPECIAL Policy Log Vocabulary to document legal bases like adequacy decisions or standard contractual clauses, ensuring data controllers can demonstrate compliance but focus on logging without managing complexities across jurisdictions. Fatema et al. [fatema2017a] present CDMM with a Permission component to record legal bases, aiming to demonstrate compliance but may need additional components for comprehensive cross-jurisdictional compliance management. Torre et al. [torre2021a] extend the GDPR conceptual model to include adequacy decisions and safeguards, providing a framework for documenting and verifying legal bases but fall short in operationalizing these components for thorough compliance in changing regulatory environments. Kirrane et al. [kirrane2018a] document legal bases using the SPECIAL usage policy language, supporting real-time compliance verification but don't cover data destruction or anonymization, crucial for full GDPR compliance. Thus, while these systems document legal bases, they may not manage the full lifecycle of compliance actions needed for data transfers.
