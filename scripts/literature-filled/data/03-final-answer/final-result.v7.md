The examination of how diverse studies address the question of specifying the retention periods for various categories of personal data, in compliance with GDPR requirements, reveals a multifaceted landscape of methodologies and technologies. Ryan et al. [ryan2021a] propose a metadata-based approach leveraging DCAT-AP and DPV to document data processing activities, including temporal periods, which aids in listing retention periods for each category of personal data. This integration ensures that metadata can explicitly specify retention periods, aligning with GDPR's mandate to retain data only as long as necessary. Campagna et al. [campagna2020a] enhance a data provenance model to include `startedAtTime` and `endedAtTime` relations within a provenance graph, directly aiding in specifying the duration for which each category of personal data will be retained, thus contributing to answering the compliance question. Besik and Freytag [besik2019a] introduce the PaCW Ontology that includes the 'Limited Retention Period' principle, ensuring data is erased when no longer necessary, thereby supporting the retention period requirements. Bonatti et al. [bonatti2020a] utilize the SPECIAL policy language to encode envisaged time limits for data erasure, addressing Article 30's requirement and contributing to specifying retention periods for different data categories. Fatema et al. [fatema2017a] present the Consent and Data Management Model (CDMM), which incorporates the lifecycle of consent and data, including retention periods tracked by the Provenance component, ensuring data is not retained longer than necessary. However, the model may require further refinement to cover all possible retention scenarios comprehensively. Kirrane et al. [kirrane2018a] offer a scalable consent, transparency, and compliance architecture using RDF vocabularies to express usage constraints, including data retention periods. This system documents how long each category of personal data will be retained, thus aligning with GDPR requirements. Collectively, these studies provide varied yet complementary approaches to addressing the retention period specification for personal data, crucial for GDPR compliance. Each approach brings unique strengths, such as semantic metadata integration, enhanced data provenance models, ontology-based privacy compliance, machine-understandable policy languages, and scalable compliance architectures, all contributing to the overarching goal of ensuring personal data is retained no longer than necessary for its original purpose.

The studies examined in this section provide a comprehensive landscape of methodologies and frameworks for ensuring that personal data is kept up to date and accurate, and that necessary corrections are made without delay, aligning with the GDPR compliance requirements. Ryan et al. [ryan2021a] introduce a metadata-based approach using DCAT-AP and DPV to document data processing activities within a catalog, ensuring the maintenance of up-to-date and accurate data by assigning contact points and limiting scope to organizational units. This facilitates efficient updating and maintenance of records, although it does not provide explicit mechanisms for automatic data accuracy assurance. Pandit et al. [pandit2018f] employ P-Plan to track the provenance of activities, ensuring that any corrections made are recorded and linked to original activities, thereby supporting prompt updates. This approach, however, focuses more on consent changes and their impact on workflows rather than on retention periods or automatic data correction mechanisms. Ujcich et al. [ujcich2018a] propose a provenance model capturing timestamps and data change provenance, aiding in tracking when corrections are made and supporting the requirement for up-to-date and accurate data. Nevertheless, it lacks specific mechanisms for ensuring immediate data corrections and may need integration with other data quality management systems. Besik and Freytag [besik2019a] introduce the PaCW Ontology with a Consent Check component, ensuring lawful processing and necessary updates when consent changes, which indirectly aids in maintaining data accuracy. However, their model does not explicitly handle detailed data transfer documentation or retention policies. Fatema et al. [fatema2017a] propose a semantic-based Consent and Data Management Model (CDMM) incorporating processes and obligations for data correction and updates, ensuring changes are made without delay. Despite this, it might lack detailed mechanisms to ensure data remains up to date across multiple databases in complex environments. Lastly, Kirrane et al. [kirrane2018a] offer a scalable consent, transparency, and compliance system with a compliance dashboard that records and monitors data processing events, verifying that procedures for maintaining up-to-date data are in place. This system provides a robust framework for ensuring data accuracy and prompt updates, although it does not directly handle data destruction. Collectively, these studies present diverse approaches to maintaining data accuracy and timely correction, each with varying degrees of comprehensiveness and focus areas that could benefit from further integration and refinement for holistic GDPR compliance.

The question of whether retention policies and procedures are in place to ensure data are held for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which they were collected is addressed through various approaches in the referenced studies. The study by Ryan et al. [ryan2021a] integrates the Data Privacy Vocabulary (DPV) and DCAT-AP standards to support the documentation of data processing activities, including retention periods, ensuring that data are held only as long as necessary. This integration facilitates the creation of a Register of Processing Activities (ROPA) and supports Data Protection Officers (DPOs) in monitoring compliance. Similarly, the research by Besik and Freytag [besik2019a] employs the Privacy-aware Clinical Workflow (PaCW) Ontology, which includes the principle of 'Limited Retention Period' to ensure that data is not held longer than necessary, aligning with GDPR retention policies. Bonatti et al. [bonatti2020a] extend this by introducing the SPECIAL policy language, capable of encoding retention policies and envisaged time limits for data erasure, directly addressing Article 30 of the GDPR. This language enables automated compliance checking, ensuring that data is retained only for the necessary period. Fatema et al. [fatema2017a] present the Consent and Data Management Model (CDMM), which uses semantic models of provenance, processes, permissions, and obligations to manage retention policies. This model includes components that track the retention period and ensure compliance through an audit trail, although it may require more detailed guidelines for comprehensive coverage. Finally, Kirrane et al. [kirrane2018a] describe the SPECIAL system, which employs an RDF-based usage policy language to define and verify retention policies. The compliance dashboard provides transparency regarding these policies, ensuring adherence to the requirement that data is retained only as long as necessary. Collectively, these studies contribute various methodologies and tools to support and ensure that data retention policies align with GDPR requirements, providing mechanisms for documenting, verifying, and enforcing retention periods to avoid unnecessary data retention.

The systematic destruction, erasure, or anonymization of personal data when it is no longer legally required to be retained is a critical aspect of GDPR compliance, which various studies have addressed through different approaches. Ryan et al. [ryan2021a] propose a metadata-based catalog for documenting data processing activities, which includes the lifecycle of data and metadata about data destruction, thereby supporting systematic handling of personal data when it is no longer needed. This approach emphasizes the use of DCAT-AP and the Data Privacy Vocabulary (DPV) to create a Register of Processing Activities (ROPA), enabling efficient monitoring of compliance by Data Protection Officers (DPOs). Pandit et al. [pandit2018f] contribute by using P-Plan to track the provenance of data destruction activities. This method records and links workflow changes triggered by the end of data retention periods, demonstrating compliance with data destruction requirements. However, it does not specifically address retention policies. Ujcich et al. [ujcich2018a] introduce a provenance model tailored for GDPR, which captures the lifecycle of personal data, including its destruction. By maintaining a detailed record of these actions, the model aids in ensuring data is systematically handled when no longer required. Despite this, the model lacks explicit procedures for enforcing systematic destruction, erasure, or anonymization. Besik and Freytag [besik2019a] present an ontology-based approach for privacy compliance in clinical workflows. The Privacy-aware Clinical Workflow (PaCW) Ontology incorporates the 'Limited Retention Period' principle, which mandates the erasure of data when it is no longer necessary, thus addressing the systematic handling of data. While these studies contribute significantly to the question of systematic data destruction, erasure, or anonymization, each has its limitations. The metadata catalog approach supports documentation but may require additional components for comprehensive data transfer tracking [ryan2021a]. The provenance model [ujcich2018a] and P-Plan-based tracking [pandit2018f] focus on recording actions but may need more detailed mechanisms for enforcing retention policies. The PaCW Ontology [besik2019a] provides a structured framework but lacks detailed tracking of data transfers and legal bases for such transfers. Collectively, these studies provide a multifaceted perspective on ensuring that personal data is systematically destroyed, erased, or anonymized when it is no longer legally required, though further integration and enhancements are necessary to fully address all compliance aspects.

The studies ujcich2018a, bonatti2018d, fatema2017a, and kirrane2018a collectively address various aspects of the compliance question on whether all data transfers, including the nature of the data, the purpose of processing, the countries involved in the transfer, and the recipients, are comprehensively listed and documented. The model proposed by ujcich2018a includes components for tracking data transfers, origins, and destinations, which helps in listing all transfers and answering questions about data nature and purpose of processing. This model, while effective in tracking data flows, may not fully cover the complexities of international data transfers [ujcich2018a]. In contrast, the SPECIAL Policy Log Vocabulary introduced by bonatti2018d uses `ProcessingActivity` and `DataTransfer` components to document the nature of data, processing purposes, and details of cross-border transfers, including countries and recipients. This structured information supports the generation of comprehensive reports, ensuring that all relevant details are captured and accessible [bonatti2018d]. Similarly, the model by fatema2017a, through its Provenance component, documents all data transfers, including the nature of the data, processing purposes, and transfer details, ensuring thorough tracking of data flows and GDPR compliance. However, this model might require additional refinement to address specific complexities in international transfers [fatema2017a]. Additionally, the transparency dashboard in kirrane2018a records data processing and sharing events, including the nature and transfer details of data, thereby contributing positively to the compliance question by providing clear documentation of data origins, destinations, and recipients [kirrane2018a]. Overall, while each study contributes significantly to documenting and managing data transfers, capturing the full complexity of international data transfers may require an integrated approach that combines the strengths of these models to ensure comprehensive compliance with GDPR requirements.

In addressing the legal basis for data transfers, such as EU Commission adequacy decisions or standard contractual clauses, and their documentation, several studies have made significant contributions. The study by Bonatti et al. [bonatti2018d] introduces the SPECIAL Policy Log Vocabulary, which incorporates components like `LegalBasis` and `DataTransfer` to document the legal grounds for data transfers. This model ensures that each data transfer is associated with a corresponding legal basis, facilitating compliance with GDPR requirements regarding international data transfers. Similarly, Fatema et al. [fatema2017a] propose the Consent and Data Management Model (CDMM), which utilizes the `Permission` component to record and manage the legal basis for data transfers, including EU Commission adequacy decisions or standard contractual clauses. This approach ensures comprehensive documentation and management of legal bases within the CDMM framework. Torre et al. [torre2021a] extend this concept by providing a detailed model that includes adequacy decisions and appropriate safeguards, such as binding corporate rules or EU model clauses. These elements are integrated into the GDPR conceptual model and compliance rules, which can be tailored to document and verify the legal basis for data transfer. Kirrane et al. [kirrane2018a] further enhance this approach by leveraging the SPECIAL usage policy language to document the legal basis for data transfers. This system ensures that all data transfers are recorded and their legal bases are documented, thereby aiding in compliance with GDPR requirements. Collectively, these studies provide robust frameworks and models for documenting the legal basis for data transfers and ensuring that such documentation is comprehensive and aligned with GDPR mandates. By integrating vocabularies, models, and policy languages, these approaches facilitate automated compliance verification and enhance the ability of data controllers to demonstrate adherence to legal requirements for international data transfers.
