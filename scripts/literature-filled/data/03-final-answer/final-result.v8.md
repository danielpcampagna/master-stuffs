# Question 8

Existing studies have made significant advances towards addressing the requirements of GDPR compliance, particularly in the context of data retention periods. Ryan et al. ([ryan2021a]) proposed a metadata-based approach using DCAT-AP and DPV to document data processing activities and specify retention periods. This method aids in creating a comprehensive list of retention periods for each category of personal data. Similarly, Campagna et al. ([campagna2020a]) introduces provenance graphs with `startedAtTime` and `endedAtTime` relations to specify data retention durations, directly contributing to the compliance question. Besik and Freytag ([besik2019a]) introduced the PaCW Ontology, which includes the 'Limited Retention Period' principle, ensuring data is erased when no longer necessary, thereby addressing data retention requirements. Bonatti et al. ([bonatti2020a]) utilized the SPECIAL policy language to encode time limits for data erasure, aligning with Article 30â€™s requirements and providing a structured method to define retention periods. Fatema et al. ([fatema2017a]) presented the Consent and Data Management Model (CDMM), incorporating the lifecycle of consent and data, including retention periods tracked by the Provenance component. Lastly, Kirrane et al. ([kirrane2018a]) developed the SPECIAL system, which records and expresses data retention periods using RDF vocabularies, ensuring compliance with GDPR.

Despite these advancements, the existing studies exhibit certain insufficiencies in fully addressing the question of data retention periods. While Ryan et al. ([ryan2021a]) and Campagna et al. ([campagna2020a]) provide frameworks for documenting retention periods, their models may lack granularity for all possible scenarios. Besik and Freytag's PaCW Ontology ([besik2019a]) and Bonatti et al.'s SPECIAL policy language ([bonatti2020a]) offer principles and encoding for data retention, but may not cover the systematic destruction or anonymization of data comprehensively. Fatema et al. ([fatema2017a]) and Kirrane et al. ([kirrane2018a]) propose models that include retention periods, yet they may fall short in detailing automated enforcement mechanisms and addressing all complexities of international data transfers. Therefore, while these studies contribute valuable insights and tools for GDPR compliance, they are collectively insufficient in providing a comprehensive solution to the question of specifying and enforcing data retention periods for each category of personal data, necessitating further research and development to address these gaps fully.

# Question 28

The question of whether procedures are in place to ensure personal data is kept up to date and accurate, and that necessary changes are made without delay, has been partially addressed by several studies, each contributing different perspectives and components. Ryan et al. [ryan2021a] discuss the design of a data processing activities catalog that supports the maintenance of accurate and up-to-date data through documented procedures and designated contact points. Pandit et al. [pandit2018f] leverage the P-Plan to track the provenance of activities, thus ensuring that corrections to personal data are recorded and linked to original data promptly. Ujcich et al. [ujcich2018a] propose a provenance model capturing timestamps and data changes, which can help track corrections and maintain data accuracy, albeit without specific mechanisms for ensuring immediate updates. Besik and Freytag [besik2019a] introduce the Consent Check component within their ontology to ensure personal data processing is lawful and updated when consent changes. Fatema et al. [fatema2017a] offer a model focusing on the lifecycle of consent and data, incorporating procedures for data correction and updates, although it may lack automatic mechanisms to ensure data remains current across diverse databases. Lastly, Kirrane et al. [kirrane2018a] present a compliance dashboard that records and monitors data processing events, aiding in verifying procedures for data accuracy and updates.

Despite these contributions, insufficiencies remain in addressing the question comprehensively. Many studies lack specific mechanisms for ensuring that data is corrected and kept up-to-date across multiple systems immediately. Integration with more robust data quality management systems and automated tools for real-time updates is essential to fully meet the requirements. Thus, while these studies provide foundational elements, their combined efforts do not entirely fulfill the necessity of ensuring personal data accuracy and timely corrections in complex and dynamic environments.

# Question 29

Several studies have explored the documentation and implementation of data retention policies to ensure compliance with GDPR requirements for retaining data no longer than necessary. Ryan et al. [ryan2021a] proposed using DCAT-AP and DPV to document and monitor data retention periods, aiding in ensuring data is not held longer than necessary. Similarly, Besik and Freytag [besik2019a] introduced the PaCW Ontology, which includes the 'Limited Retention Period' principle to enforce data retention limits. Bonatti et al. [bonatti2020a] discussed the use of the SPECIAL policy language to encode retention policies, aligning with GDPR's time limits for data erasure. Fatema et al. [fatema2017a] utilized the CDMM to manage retention policies via its Permission and Provenance components, providing an audit trail for data retention decisions. Kirrane et al. [kirrane2018a] incorporated retention policy definitions within the SPECIAL usage policy language, enhancing transparency and compliance verification through a compliance dashboard.

Despite these contributions, these studies fall short in providing a comprehensive solution to the question, "Are retention policies and procedures in place to ensure data are held for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which they were collected?" While they offer mechanisms to document and, in some cases, monitor retention periods, they often lack the detailed guidelines and enforcement mechanisms required to cover all possible scenarios. Moreover, they may not fully address the complexities of automating data destruction, erasure, or anonymization processes, nor do they adequately cover the granularity needed for diverse data categories and varying retention needs across different jurisdictions. Thus, these studies are insufficient to fully ensure that data retention policies are robustly enforced and universally applicable across all potential use cases.

# Question 51

The current body of research offers several methodologies that contribute to understanding and ensuring the destruction, erasure, or anonymization of personal data when it is no longer legally required. Ryan et al. [ryan2021a] propose a semantic metadata-based approach to document the lifecycle of data processing activities, including the end-of-life handling of data. This ensures that compliance with data destruction requirements can be systematically documented. Pandit et al. [pandit2018f] utilize P-Plan to track the provenance of data destruction activities, thereby linking workflow changes to demonstrate compliance when personal data is no longer required. Ujcich et al. [ujcich2018a] introduce a data provenance model that records the history and lifecycle of data, including the documentation of destruction, erasure, or anonymization actions, although it lacks specific systematic procedures for handling data when it is no longer needed. Besik and Freytag [besik2019a] address data privacy in clinical workflows through an ontology-based approach, incorporating the 'Limited Retention Period' principle to ensure systematic destruction or anonymization of data.

Despite these contributions, these studies exhibit limitations in comprehensively addressing whether personal data are systematically destroyed, erased, or anonymised when no longer legally required. Ryan et al. [ryan2021a] focus more on documenting activities rather than implementing specific destruction processes. Pandit et al. [pandit2018f] emphasize provenance tracking but do not provide detailed mechanisms for enforcing data destruction policies. Ujcich et al. [ujcich2018a] document actions but lack procedures for systematic data handling post-retention. Besik and Freytag [besik2019a] incorporate retention principles but do not detail the execution of destruction procedures. Collectively, while these studies contribute valuable frameworks and mechanisms, they fall short of providing a fully systematic and procedurally detailed solution to ensure the proper handling of personal data at the end of its legal retention period.

# Question 63

Recent studies have made significant contributions towards addressing the question of whether all data transfers are listed, including details such as the nature of the data, the purpose of processing, the countries involved in data export and import, and the recipients of the data transfers. Ujcich et al. [ujcich2018a] propose a data provenance model tailored to the GDPR, which includes components for tracking data transfers, origins, and destinations of data. This model supports the requirement to document data transfers and can help answer questions about the nature and purpose of data processing. Similarly, Bonatti et al. [bonatti2018d] introduce the SPECIAL Policy Log Vocabulary, which uses `ProcessingActivity` and `DataTransfer` components to document the nature of the data, the purpose of processing, and details about cross-border data transfers, including the countries and recipients involved. This structured approach ensures detailed and accessible documentation of data transfers.

Further, Fatema et al. [fatema2017a] present a Consent and Data Management Model (CDMM) that uses a Provenance component to document all data transfers comprehensively, including data nature, processing purposes, and transfer details. This model aims to ensure compliance with GDPR requirements through detailed tracking of data flows. Kirrane et al. [kirrane2018a] offer a transparency dashboard that records data processing and sharing events, including transfer details such as the nature of the data, its purpose, origin, destination, and recipient. This dashboard can significantly contribute to answering questions about data transfers by providing detailed documentation.

Despite these advancements, there remain gaps and insufficiencies in these studies to fully address the question at hand. While each model provides robust mechanisms for tracking various aspects of data transfers, none of them comprehensively cover all complexities involved in international data transfers. Specifically, Ujcich et al. [ujcich2018a] do not explicitly address the legal basis for data transfers, a crucial aspect for GDPR compliance. Bonatti et al. [bonatti2018d] and Fatema et al. [fatema2017a] might lack the granularity required for specific retention scenarios and the mechanisms to ensure data accuracy and prompt updates across complex environments. Kirrane et al. [kirrane2018a] do not handle the destruction, erasure, or anonymization of data explicitly, which is essential for comprehensive compliance. Thus, while these studies provide valuable frameworks and tools, they are insufficient to fully address the question of listing all data transfers, including every necessary detail for complete GDPR compliance.

# Question 64

The question of whether there is a legal basis for the transfer of data, such as an EU Commission adequacy decision or standard contractual clauses, and whether these bases are documented, is addressed to varying extents by the studies in question. Bonatti et al. [bonatti2018d] introduce the `LegalBasis` component within their SPECIAL Policy Log Vocabulary, enabling the documentation of the legal basis for data transfers and ensuring compliance with GDPR requirements. Similarly, Fatema et al. [fatema2017a] incorporate a `Permission` component within their Consent and Data Management Model (CDMM) that records the legal basis for data transfers, such as EU Commission adequacy decisions or standard contractual clauses. Torre et al. [torre2021a] provide a comprehensive model that includes concepts like adequacy decisions and binding corporate rules, which can be tailored to document and verify the legal basis for data transfers. Kirrane et al. [kirrane2018a] utilize the SPECIAL usage policy language to document the legal basis for data transfers, thereby aiding compliance by recording all transfers and their legal bases.

While each of these studies contributes valuable components and frameworks for documenting the legal basis for data transfers, they exhibit certain insufficiencies in addressing the question comprehensively. Bonatti et al. [bonatti2018d] and Fatema et al. [fatema2017a] might require additional components to ensure proper management across different jurisdictions. Torre et al. [torre2021a] provide a high-level framework that may lack detailed operational procedures for documenting every aspect of data transfers. Kirrane et al. [kirrane2018a] focus on transparency and compliance but do not explicitly handle the enforcement or automation of data destruction processes, which are crucial for comprehensive compliance. Thus, while these studies provide significant strides towards addressing the question, they collectively fall short of offering a complete solution that thoroughly documents the legal basis for data transfers across varying regulatory environments and operational contexts.
