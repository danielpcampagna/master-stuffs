In the realm of GDPR compliance and data provenance, several notable contributions have been made, each addressing various aspects of compliance challenges. However, gaps remain that our proposed extension to the GDPRov model aims to fill. The existing literature provides a foundation upon which we build, enhancing the model's ability to address previously uncovered compliance questions.

The GDPRov model, as presented by Pandit et al. in [[Pandit2020]], offers a structured and comprehensive way to document GDPR compliance activities by extending PROV-O and P-Plan to cover specific GDPR requirements. While GDPRov effectively represents planned and executed activities related to personal data processing, it lacks components to specify data retention periods, ensure data accuracy, and manage the systematic destruction of personal data. Our contribution extends GDPRov to address these gaps by integrating new ontologies, such as the SSN Ontology for representing sensor components that trigger data deletion based on legal requirements.

Similarly, the work by Ryan et al. in [[Ryan2021]] presents a novel approach to describing and integrating diverse data processing activities using DCAT-AP and DPV. This approach facilitates the documentation of retention periods and procedures for data accuracy and updates. However, it does not explicitly cover comprehensive data transfer details or the legal basis for such transfers. Our extension builds on this by incorporating mechanisms to document and verify the legal bases for data transfers, ensuring complete compliance with GDPR requirements.

Another significant contribution is by Pandit et al. in [[Pandit2018_GDPRChangeDetection]], which focuses on detecting and representing changes in consent and activities for GDPR compliance using P-Plan and ODRL. While this approach effectively models consent changes and workflow provenance, it falls short in addressing data retention periods and systematic data destruction. Our work enhances this by introducing components that specify and enforce data retention policies and automate data deletion processes.

The ontology-based model proposed by Campagna et al. in [[Campagna2020]] aims to achieve GDPR compliance through provenance but does not fully address data accuracy, retention policies, or the legal basis for data transfers. By integrating new ontologies, our extension ensures that personal data is kept up to date, retention policies are enforced, and legal bases for data transfers are documented, thus filling these critical gaps.

Finally, the scalable architecture proposed by Kirrane et al. in [[Kirrane2018]] integrates consent management, transparency, and compliance monitoring to handle large-scale data processing activities. While it provides a robust framework for managing consent and ensuring transparency, it may lack detailed mechanisms to automatically enforce data deletion once the retention period has expired. Our extension incorporates sensor-based triggers using the SSN Ontology to automate data deletion, enhancing the architecture's ability to comply with GDPR's data retention and destruction requirements.

Through these enhancements, our proposed extension to the GDPRov model not only builds on the existing literature but also addresses the uncovered compliance questions, ensuring a more comprehensive and automated approach to GDPR compliance.
