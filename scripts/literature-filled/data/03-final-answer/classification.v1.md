Approach and Motivations:
  Question 8:
    score: 100
    justification: The approach documents data processing activities in terms of their temporal period, aiding in listing the retention period for each category of personal data using DCAT-AP and DPV.
  Question 28:
    score: 100
    justification: Procedures for ensuring data accuracy and updates are supported by the catalog's design, which includes assigning contact points and limiting scope to organizational units.
  Question 29:
    score: 100
    justification: DCAT-AP and DPV support the documentation of retention policies, ensuring data are held no longer than necessary.
  Question 51:
    score: 100
    justification: The catalog includes metadata about the destruction, erasure, or anonymization of personal data by documenting the lifecycle of data processing activities.
  Question 63:
    score: 0
    justification: The paper does not specify if the catalog can comprehensively list all data transfers, including details such as the nature of the data, processing purposes, and recipient information.
  Question 64:
    score: 0
    justification: The current model does not explicitly cover documenting the legal basis for data transfers, such as EU Commission adequacy decisions or standard contractual clauses.

Pandit, Harshvardhan J, Oâ€™Sullivan, Declan, and Lewis, Dave. GDPR-driven Change Detection in Consent and Activity Metadata. 2018:
  Question 8:
    score: 0
    justification: The approach lacks components to record and query the retention period for each category of personal data. The focus is on consent changes and workflow provenance, not on retention periods.
  Question 28:
    score: 100
    justification: The approach ensures that personal data is kept up to date and accurate by using P-Plan to track the provenance of activities. When a correction is made, the changes can be recorded and linked to the original activities, ensuring updates are made without delay.
  Question 29:
    score: 0
    justification: While the approach tracks changes in workflows and consent, it does not provide detailed mechanisms for enforcing retention policies and procedures. Additional components or policies would be needed to fully address this question.
  Question 51:
    score: 100
    justification: The approach can contribute to ensuring personal data is systematically destroyed, erased, or anonymized when no longer required by using P-Plan to track the provenance of data destruction activities. Workflow changes can be recorded and linked to demonstrate compliance with data destruction requirements.
  Question 63:
    score: 0
    justification: The current model does not cover the detailed tracking of data transfers, including the nature of the data, the purpose of processing, and the recipient information. The focus is primarily on consent changes and activity provenance.
  Question 64:
    score: 0
    justification: The approach does not address the legal basis for data transfers or the documentation of such bases. Additional components would be required to track and document the legal justifications for data transfers.

  - Question 8:
      score: 20
      justification: The model includes temporal components to track data activities, which can partially address the requirement to list the data retention period. However, it does not explicitly provide a mechanism for specifying data retention periods for different categories of personal data.
  - Question 28:
      score: 50
      justification: The model can track updates to personal data and incorporates design patterns for data collection and consent.
