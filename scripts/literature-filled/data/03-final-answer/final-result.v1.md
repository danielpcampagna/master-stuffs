The GDPRov model, designed to represent activities and consent information related to the processing of personal data, has made significant strides in documenting both planned (ex-ante) and executed (ex-post) activities to demonstrate GDPR compliance. However, there are areas where it falls short, particularly concerning the systematic destruction, erasure, or anonymization of personal data when it is no longer legally required. Our proposed extension aims to address these gaps by integrating new ontologies, such as the SSN Ontology for representing sensor components, to automate data deletion based on legal bases.

One of the closely related works is the SPECIAL Policy Log Vocabulary by Bonatti et al. (2018), which provides a structured approach to logging and querying data processing activities. While it effectively documents the legal basis for data transfers and facilitates transparency, it does not explicitly cover the systematic destruction or anonymization of data. Consequently, it cannot fully ensure that personal data is erased when no longer required, a gap that our proposed model addresses by incorporating event-based triggers for data deletion.

Similarly, the work by Ryan et al. (2021) on building a Data Processing Activities Catalog using DCAT-AP and DPV extends metadata-based approaches to describe and integrate diverse data processing activities. This model is adept at documenting data retention periods and ensuring data accuracy. However, it falls short in comprehensively listing all data transfers and documenting the legal basis for these transfers. Our extension to GDPRov addresses these insufficiencies by integrating additional ontologies to capture detailed transfer information and legal justifications, thus enhancing compliance documentation.

The provenance model proposed by Ujcich et al. (2018) captures the history and lifecycle of data, including its origins, transformations, and usage. This model includes temporal reasoning to ensure data is held no longer than necessary, which is crucial for data retention policies. However, it lacks specific mechanisms for the destruction, erasure, or anonymization of personal data, which our work addresses by embedding SSN Ontology components to automate these processes based on legal requirements.

The ontology-based approach by Bartolini et al. (2015) integrates data protection requirements into workflows, providing a structured means for assessing GDPR compliance. While this model helps data controllers understand their obligations and ensures data accuracy, it does not include specific provisions for data retention periods or systematic data erasure. By extending GDPRov with new ontologies, our work fills these gaps, ensuring comprehensive compliance with GDPR's data lifecycle requirements.

Lastly, the framework proposed by Kirrane et al. (2018) incorporates Semantic Web technologies and Linked Data principles to facilitate consent management, transparency, and compliance. While it provides a scalable and flexible solution for data governance, it may lack detailed mechanisms to enforce data deletion automatically once the retention period has expired. Our extension to GDPRov leverages sensor-based event triggers to ensure that data is systematically erased when no longer legally required, thus enhancing the framework's compliance capabilities.

In summary, while the existing literature provides robust frameworks and models for GDPR compliance, they often fall short in addressing specific compliance questions related to data retention, accuracy, and systematic erasure. Our proposed extension to GDPRov, through the integration of new ontologies like SSN, aims to bridge these gaps, offering a more comprehensive and automated solution for GDPR compliance.
