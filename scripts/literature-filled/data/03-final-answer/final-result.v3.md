In the domain of GDPR compliance, several significant contributions have been made to develop models and frameworks that assist organizations in managing personal data in accordance with the regulation. Among the most relevant to our work is the GDPRov model proposed by Pandit, Oâ€™Sullivan, and Lewis, which focuses on representing activities and consent information associated with personal data processing using a provenance ontology [[PANDIT, HARSHVARDHAN JITENDRA. Representing Activities associated with Processing of Personal Data and Consent using Semantic Web for GDPR Compliance. 2020]]. While GDPRov extends PROV-O and P-Plan to cover compliance requirements and effectively documents planned and executed activities, it lacks specific components to ensure data accuracy, retention policies, and the systematic destruction or anonymization of personal data once it is no longer legally required.

Building on the foundational work of GDPRov, the paper by Ryan, Paul and Pandit, Harshvardhan J and Brennan, Rob introduces an approach that extends the well-known DCAT-AP standard by incorporating the Data Privacy Vocabulary (DPV) to create a Register of Processing Activities (ROPA) [[Ryan, Paul and Pandit, Harshvardhan J and Brennan, Rob. Building a Data Processing Activities Catalog: Representing Heterogeneous Compliance-Related Information for GDPR Using DCAT-AP and DPV. 2021]]. This method effectively documents data processing activities and supports answering compliance questions related to data retention and accuracy. However, it does not comprehensively list all data transfers or address the legal basis for data transfers, which are critical for full GDPR compliance.

Another significant contribution comes from Bonatti, Piero A and Kirrane, Sabrina and Petrova, Iliana M and Sauro, Luigi, who developed a machine-understandable policy language to automate GDPR compliance checking [[Bonatti, Piero A and Kirrane, Sabrina and Petrova, Iliana M and Sauro, Luigi. Machine understandable policies and GDPR compliance checking. 2020]]. Their SPECIAL H2020 project employs this policy language to encode consent, business policies, and regulatory obligations, enabling automated compliance verification. While this approach can define retention periods and document the legal basis for data transfers, it lacks mechanisms to ensure data is kept up to date and does not cover the systematic destruction or anonymization of personal data.

In the realm of ontology-based approaches, Bartolini, Cesare and Muthuri, Robert and Santos, Cristiana introduced an ontology to model data protection requirements within workflows [[Bartolini, Cesare and Muthuri, Robert and Santos, Cristiana. Using ontologies to model data protection requirements in workflows. 2015]]. Their work provides a structured means of assessing compliance and detecting potential violations. However, the ontology's granularity is coarse, and it lacks specific provisions to enforce data retention periods, ensure data accuracy, or manage the destruction of personal data systematically.

Additionally, the work of Campagna, Daniel Prett, da Silva, Altigran Soares, and Braganholo, Vanessa proposes an extended data provenance model aimed at achieving GDPR compliance through enhanced transparency [[Campagna, Daniel Prett, da Silva, Altigran Soares, and Braganholo, Vanessa. Achieving GDPR Compliance through Provenance: An Extended Model. 2020]]. While this model addresses some gaps in existing provenance models and includes temporal components to track data activities, it does not fully cover the requirements for data accuracy, retention policies, or the legal basis for data transfers.

In summary, while the existing literature provides robust frameworks and models for GDPR compliance, they each have limitations in comprehensively addressing all compliance questions, particularly those related to data accuracy, retention, systematic destruction, and the legal basis for data transfers. Our proposed extension of the GDPRov model aims to bridge these gaps by introducing new ontologies, such as the SSN Ontology for sensor components, to ensure that data is deleted based on the event that the data no longer has a legal basis. This enhancement aims to provide a more holistic and compliant approach to managing personal data in line with GDPR requirements.
