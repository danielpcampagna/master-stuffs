The studies reviewed in this section collectively contribute valuable insights into addressing the question of specifying retention periods for various categories of personal data. Ryan et al. [ryan2021a] document data processing activities and utilize DCAT-AP and DPV to specify retention periods within metadata, supporting the creation of a Register of Processing Activities (ROPA). Campagna et al. [campagna2020a] extend a data provenance model to include `startedAtTime` and `endedAtTime` relations, which indicate the duration of data retention. Besik et al. [besik2019a] integrate the 'Limited Retention Period' principle within the PaCW Ontology, ensuring data is erased when no longer necessary. Bonatti et al. [bonatti2020a] leverage the SPECIAL policy language to encode retention time limits, directly aligning with GDPR requirements. Fatema et al. [fatema2017a] incorporate retention periods into their Consent and Data Management Model (CDMM), using provenance to track these periods. Lastly, Kirrane et al. [kirrane2018a] employ RDF vocabularies to document data retention periods through the SPECIAL system, enhancing compliance verification.

Despite these contributions, each study demonstrates insufficiencies in fully addressing the question comprehensively. The solutions proposed by Ryan et al. [ryan2021a] and Campagna et al. [campagna2020a] do not explicitly cover all possible retention scenarios and may require additional components to ensure complete documentation of data transfers and legal bases. Besik et al. [besik2019a] and Bonatti et al. [bonatti2020a] lack detailed mechanisms for systematic data destruction, erasure, or anonymization. Fatema et al. [fatema2017a] might not fully address the granularity required for all retention scenarios and may need further refinement to ensure data remains up-to-date across multiple systems. Kirrane et al. [kirrane2018a] do not directly handle data destruction processes, which is a critical aspect of ensuring data is not retained longer than necessary. Collectively, while these studies provide a foundation for specifying data retention periods, they highlight the need for comprehensive solutions that address the full spectrum of GDPR compliance requirements.

The studies reviewed provide valuable insights into various aspects of GDPR compliance, yet they collectively fall short of comprehensively addressing the specific question: "Are procedures in place to ensure personal data is kept up to date and accurate and where a correction is required, the necessary changes are made without delay?" For instance, the approach proposed by [ryan2021a] offers a cataloging system that supports data accuracy maintenance through assigning contact points and limiting the scope to organizational units, yet it does not detail mechanisms for real-time data correction. Similarly, [pandit2018f] employs P-Plan to track the provenance of activities and record changes, ensuring updates are made promptly, but lacks comprehensive enforcement mechanisms to ensure data accuracy across complex systems. The model presented by [ujcich2018a] includes design patterns for tracking data corrections with timestamps, but it does not offer specific mechanisms for ensuring immediate updates, suggesting a need for integration with other data quality management systems. The approach by [besik2019a] includes a 'Consent Check' component that ensures lawful data processing and updates, but it does not address the automatic updating of data across multiple databases. While [fatema2017a] introduces a semantic model that defines procedures for data correction and updates, it may lack detailed mechanisms to ensure data remains up to date across diverse systems. Lastly, the compliance dashboard in [kirrane2018a] aids in monitoring data processing events and ensuring data accuracy, but it does not explicitly handle the promptness of data corrections. Collectively, these studies highlight essential elements for maintaining data accuracy and timeliness; however, they each exhibit insufficiencies that prevent them from wholly addressing the question, particularly in terms of ensuring real-time, system-wide data updates and corrections. Further research is required to integrate these partial solutions into a comprehensive system capable of automatic, immediate, and accurate data updates.

The question of whether retention policies and procedures are in place to ensure data are held no longer than necessary for the purposes for which they were collected is partially addressed by several studies, yet none fully encapsulate the complexity and requirements of comprehensive retention management. Ryan et al. [ryan2021a] leverage DCAT-AP and DPV to document retention policies, facilitating the specification of data retention periods. However, the approach lacks mechanisms for comprehensive enforcement across diverse data sources. Besik and Freytag [besik2019a] introduce the 'Limited Retention Period' principle within their PaCW Ontology, aligning with retention policies, yet their focus on clinical workflows may not generalize well to other domains. Bonatti et al. [bonatti2020a] utilize the SPECIAL policy language to encode retention policies, but their approach does not explicitly address the systematic destruction or anonymization of data, which is crucial for complete compliance. Fatema et al. [fatema2017a] propose the CDMM, incorporating components like Permission and Provenance to manage retention policies, but the model may require more detailed guidelines and enforcement mechanisms to handle all possible scenarios comprehensively. Kirrane et al. [kirrane2018a] provide a scalable system that records and verifies retention policies through a compliance dashboard, yet it lacks explicit components for data destruction, limiting its efficacy in fully ensuring data are held no longer than necessary. Collectively, these studies provide valuable frameworks and tools, but they fall short of offering a fully integrated and enforceable solution for managing data retention comprehensively across varying contexts and data lifecycle stages.

The question of whether personal data are systematically destroyed, erased, or anonymised when no longer legally required is crucial for GDPR compliance. Several studies have attempted to address this issue, each contributing valuable insights while also displaying notable insufficiencies. Ryan et al. [ryan2021a] document the lifecycle of data processing activities and include metadata about data destruction, erasure, or anonymization, thus supporting the systematic handling of data no longer required. However, the study does not provide specific procedures for ensuring this systematic approach. Pandit et al. [pandit2018f] employ P-Plan to track the provenance of data destruction activities, linking workflow changes to compliance. Yet, their approach lacks components to enforce retention policies and systematic handling of data once it is no longer necessary. Ujcich et al. [ujcich2018a] propose a data provenance model that documents the destruction, erasure, or anonymization of data, but similar to the previous studies, it does not include specific procedures for systematic data handling. Besik and Freytag [besik2019a] introduce the 'Limited Retention Period' principle within an ontology-based framework, addressing the requirement for systematic data destruction, erasure, or anonymization. Nonetheless, this approach does not cover the detailed mechanisms necessary to guarantee systematic data handling. Collectively, while these studies contribute to documenting and tracking data destruction activities, they fall short in providing comprehensive procedures to ensure systematic destruction, erasure, or anonymization when personal data are no longer legally required, highlighting the need for further research and development in this area.

The existing studies provide valuable insights into documenting data transfers, but there are notable insufficiencies in fully addressing the complexities of the question posed. Ujcich et al. [ujcich2018a] present a provenance model that includes components for tracking the origins and destinations of data transfers, which can help list transfers and answer questions about the nature and purpose of data processing. However, the model lacks explicit components to document the legal basis for data transfers, a crucial aspect for comprehensive compliance. Bonatti et al. [bonatti2018d] introduce the SPECIAL Policy Log Vocabulary, which includes `ProcessingActivity` and `DataTransfer` components that capture detailed information about cross-border data transfers, including involved countries and recipients. Despite this, the model does not include components for documenting data retention periods or ensuring data accuracy and timely corrections, limiting its ability to fully address all related compliance questions. Fatema et al. [fatema2017a] propose a Consent and Data Management Model (CDMM) that documents data transfers comprehensively, including the nature of the data, processing purpose, and transfer details. Nevertheless, the model might not fully cover the granularity required for all international data transfer scenarios and specific legal requirements. Kirrane et al. [kirrane2018a] present a transparency dashboard that records data processing and sharing events, which can be used to answer questions about data transfers, including the purpose, origin, destination, and recipient. However, the system does not explicitly handle the destruction, erasure, or anonymization of data, which is a crucial part of data lifecycle management. Collectively, while these studies contribute significantly to documenting and understanding data transfers, they fall short in addressing the full spectrum of compliance requirements, particularly in documenting the legal basis for transfers, ensuring data accuracy, and managing retention and destruction policies comprehensively.

The question of whether there is a legal basis for data transfers, such as EU Commission adequacy decisions or standard contractual clauses, and whether these bases are documented, is a critical aspect of GDPR compliance. Several studies have explored mechanisms for documenting and verifying the legal bases for data transfers, but they present varying degrees of sufficiency in addressing this question comprehensively. Bonatti et al. [bonatti2018d] introduce the `LegalBasis` component within the SPECIAL Policy Log Vocabulary, which can document the legal basis for data transfers, thus ensuring that data controllers can demonstrate compliance with GDPR. Similarly, Fatema et al. [fatema2017a] utilize the `Permission` component within the Consent and Data Management Model (CDMM) to record the legal basis for data transfers, albeit with a need for additional components to manage jurisdictional nuances. Torre et al. [torre2021a] provide a detailed GDPR conceptual model that includes adequacy decisions and appropriate safeguards, which can be tailored to document the legal basis for data transfers. However, the study primarily focuses on structural representations and lacks operational details for complete documentation. Kirrane et al. [kirrane2018a] leverage the SPECIAL usage policy language to document the legal basis for data transfers, integrating this documentation within a broader transparency and compliance framework. Despite these contributions, none of the studies fully address the complexities involved in international data transfers, particularly across different jurisdictions and regulatory environments. The need for a more granular approach to documenting and managing legal bases across diverse scenarios remains a gap that future research must aim to fill.
