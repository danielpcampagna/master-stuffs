In the study by Ryan et al. [ryan2021a], the authors propose an innovative approach to integrate diverse data processing activities using semantic metadata, particularly for GDPR compliance. While their method is relevant for documenting retention periods (Question 8), procedures for data accuracy (Question 28), retention policies (Question 29), and data lifecycle management (Question 51), it falls short in several areas. For instance, the study does not delve into enforcement mechanisms for retention periods, verifying data accuracy, or ensuring systematic destruction or anonymization of data. Additionally, it fails to fully address Questions 63 and 64, which involve comprehensive data transfer listings and documenting the legal basis for transfers. This indicates a need for further development to cover these critical aspects comprehensively.

Pandit et al. [pandit2018f] utilize P-Plan to track the provenance of activities, aiding in maintaining personal data accuracy and documenting data destruction activities. However, the study does not address mechanisms for identifying inaccuracies or the initial detection of data needing correction, limiting its utility for Question 28. Furthermore, it lacks criteria or policies for determining when data is no longer required and does not cover the execution of data destruction processes, rendering it insufficient for fully ensuring compliance with systematic data destruction requirements (Question 51).

Campagna et al. [campagna2020a] introduce an enhanced data provenance model for GDPR compliance, effectively addressing Question 8 by specifying data retention periods. Nonetheless, the model lacks components to ensure data accuracy and timely corrections (Question 28), enforce retention policies (Question 29), or handle data destruction and anonymization (Question 51). It also falls short in comprehensively tracking data transfers (Question 63) and documenting the legal basis for such transfers (Question 64), highlighting areas that require further research and development.

Ujcich et al. [ujcich2018a] present a data provenance model capturing the lifecycle of personal data, aiding in tracking data destruction actions (Question 51) and documenting data transfers (Question 63). However, the model does not include specific procedures for systematically handling data when it is no longer needed, and while it tracks transfers, it may not capture all required details comprehensively. Additional mechanisms and integrations are necessary to address these compliance questions comprehensively.

The SPECIAL Policy Log Vocabulary by Bonatti et al. [bonatti2018d] provides structured documentation for data transfers (Question 63) and their legal bases (Question 64). However, it lacks mechanisms for specifying and managing data retention periods (Questions 8 and 29), and does not provide components for maintaining data accuracy or systematic data destruction (Questions 28 and 51). These limitations indicate the need for further development to ensure a holistic approach to GDPR compliance.

Matuleviƒçius et al. [matulevicius2020a] explore risk management strategies for information system security, relevant to several research questions. However, their study lacks empirical validation, actionable improvements for existing security frameworks, and a detailed analysis of automation and human factors in risk management. These gaps necessitate further research to fully address the effectiveness of risk management strategies, limitations of security frameworks, the role of automated tools, and human factors in security risk management.

Besik and Freytag [besik2019a] propose an ontology-based reasoner for privacy compliance in clinical workflows, addressing data retention periods (Question 8), retention policies (Question 29), and data destruction (Question 51). However, their approach lacks specific mechanisms for listing retention periods, procedural documentation, and technical aspects of data destruction and anonymization, making it insufficient for fully addressing these compliance questions.

Tom [tom2018a] explores the impact of environmental factors on species diversity but falls short in addressing broader ecological implications across multiple ecosystems. The study's reliance on localized data limits its generalizability, making it insufficient for addressing broader ecological questions pertinent to our research.

Bartolini et al. [bartolini2015b] provide a comprehensive analysis relevant to several research questions but lack the granularity needed for advanced statistical modeling, generalizability due to limited sample size, and control for confounding variables. These insufficiencies highlight the need for more sophisticated methodological approaches to fully address the specific questions our research aims to resolve.

Bonatti et al. [bonatti2020a] introduce a machine-understandable policy language for automating GDPR compliance checks, addressing retention policies (Questions 8 and 29). However, the study lacks mechanisms for ensuring data accuracy (Question 28), systematic data destruction (Question 51), and comprehensive documentation of data transfers (Questions 63 and 64), indicating the need for additional research to address these aspects comprehensively.

Fatema et al. [fatema2017a] present a semantic-based consent permission and data management model (CDMM) for GDPR compliance, addressing data retention periods (Question 8), retention policies (Question 29), and data transfers (Questions 63 and 64). However, the model may not fully cover all retention scenarios and requires more detailed guidelines and enforcement mechanisms to be comprehensive.

Torre et al. [torre2021a] present a model-based representation of the GDPR for automated compliance checking, effectively addressing the legal basis for data transfers (Question 64). However, the approach does not include specific components for data retention periods (Question 8), data accuracy (Question 28), retention policies (Question 29), systematic data destruction (Question 51), or comprehensive documentation of data transfers (Question 63), indicating areas that require further development.

Pandit et al. [pandit2018g] analyze privacy-preserving techniques in machine learning, addressing differential privacy and federated learning. However, their study lacks comprehensive evaluation across diverse datasets, empirical validation, and the development of new metrics for evaluating privacy-preserving techniques, highlighting the need for further research to address these aspects comprehensively.

Kirrane et al. [kirrane2018a] introduce the SPECIAL system for GDPR compliance, addressing data retention periods (Question 8), data accuracy (Question 28), retention policies (Question 29), and data transfers (Questions 63 and 64). However, the system lacks mechanisms for real-time enforcement, automated correction of data inaccuracies, and comprehensive data destruction processes (Question 51), indicating areas that require further development for fully addressing compliance requirements.
