Existing studies have made significant advances towards addressing the requirements of GDPR compliance, particularly in the context of data retention periods. Ryan et al. ([ryan2021a]) proposed a metadata-based approach using DCAT-AP and DPV to document data processing activities and specify retention periods, aiding in creating a comprehensive list for each category of personal data. Similarly, Campagna et al. ([campagna2020a]) introduced provenance graphs with `startedAtTime` and `endedAtTime` relations, directly contributing to compliance. Besik and Freytag ([besik2019a]) introduced the PaCW Ontology, including the 'Limited Retention Period' principle, ensuring data erasure when no longer necessary. Bonatti et al. ([bonatti2020a]) utilized the SPECIAL policy language to encode time limits for data erasure, aligning with Article 30. Fatema et al. ([fatema2017a]) presented the Consent and Data Management Model (CDMM), incorporating the lifecycle of consent and data, including retention periods tracked by the Provenance component. Kirrane et al. ([kirrane2018a]) developed the SPECIAL system, expressing data retention periods using RDF vocabularies. Despite these advancements, existing studies exhibit certain insufficiencies in fully addressing data retention periods. For instance, Ryan et al. ([ryan2021a]) and Campagna et al. ([campagna2020a]) may lack granularity for all scenarios. The PaCW Ontology and SPECIAL policy language offer principles and encoding but may not cover systematic destruction or anonymization comprehensively. Fatema et al. ([fatema2017a]) and Kirrane et al. ([kirrane2018a]) propose models that include retention periods, yet may fall short in detailing automated enforcement mechanisms and addressing international data transfers complexities. Therefore, while these studies contribute valuable insights and tools for GDPR compliance, they are collectively insufficient in providing a comprehensive solution, necessitating further research and development.

The question of whether procedures are in place to ensure personal data is kept up to date and accurate, and that necessary changes are made without delay, has been partially addressed by several studies, each contributing different perspectives and components. Ryan et al. ([ryan2021a]) discuss a data processing activities catalog that supports data maintenance through documented procedures and contact points. Pandit et al. ([pandit2018f]) leverage the P-Plan to track activity provenance, ensuring corrections are recorded and linked promptly. Ujcich et al. ([ujcich2018a]) propose a provenance model capturing timestamps and data changes to help maintain data accuracy, though without specific mechanisms for immediate updates. Besik and Freytag ([besik2019a]) introduce the Consent Check component within their ontology to ensure data processing is lawful and updated with consent changes. Fatema et al. ([fatema2017a]) offer a model focusing on consent and data lifecycle, incorporating data correction procedures, though lacking automatic mechanisms to ensure currency across databases. Kirrane et al. ([kirrane2018a]) present a compliance dashboard to verify data accuracy procedures. Despite these contributions, insufficiencies remain. Many studies lack specific mechanisms for ensuring immediate data corrections across multiple systems. Integration with more robust data quality management systems and automated tools for real-time updates is essential. Thus, while these studies provide foundational elements, their combined efforts do not fully meet the requirements of ensuring personal data accuracy and timely corrections in complex environments.

Several studies have explored the documentation and implementation of data retention policies to ensure GDPR compliance in retaining data no longer than necessary. Ryan et al. ([ryan2021a]) proposed using DCAT-AP and DPV to document and monitor data retention periods. Besik and Freytag ([besik2019a]) introduced the PaCW Ontology, enforcing data retention limits. Bonatti et al. ([bonatti2020a]) discussed the use of the SPECIAL policy language to encode retention policies. Fatema et al. ([fatema2017a]) utilized the CDMM to manage retention policies via its Permission and Provenance components, providing an audit trail. Kirrane et al. ([kirrane2018a]) incorporated retention policy definitions within the SPECIAL usage policy language. Despite these contributions, these studies fall short in fully addressing whether retention policies and procedures ensure data is held only as long as necessary. They offer mechanisms to document and monitor retention periods but often lack detailed guidelines and enforcement mechanisms for all scenarios. They may not fully address complexities in automating data destruction, erasure, or anonymization processes, nor cover the granularity needed for diverse data categories across jurisdictions. Thus, these studies are insufficient to ensure robust and universally applicable data retention policies.

The current body of research offers several methodologies for understanding and ensuring the destruction, erasure, or anonymization of personal data when no longer legally required. Ryan et al. ([ryan2021a]) propose a semantic metadata-based approach to document data processing activities, including end-of-life handling. Pandit et al. ([pandit2018f]) utilize P-Plan to track data destruction activities' provenance. Ujcich et al. ([ujcich2018a]) introduce a provenance model recording data lifecycle and destruction actions. Besik and Freytag ([besik2019a]) incorporate the 'Limited Retention Period' principle in clinical workflows. Despite these contributions, these studies exhibit limitations in comprehensively addressing systematic destruction, erasure, or anonymization. Ryan et al. ([ryan2021a]) focus more on documenting activities rather than implementing destruction processes. Pandit et al. ([pandit2018f]) emphasize provenance tracking but lack detailed enforcement mechanisms. Ujcich et al. ([ujcich2018a]) document actions but lack post-retention data handling procedures. Besik and Freytag ([besik2019a]) incorporate retention principles but do not detail destruction execution. Collectively, while valuable, these studies fall short of providing a fully systematic and procedurally detailed solution for proper data handling at the end of its legal retention period.

Recent studies have contributed towards listing all data transfers, including details such as data nature, processing purposes, countries involved, and recipients. Ujcich et al. ([ujcich2018a]) propose a GDPR-tailored data provenance model tracking data transfers. Bonatti et al. ([bonatti2018d]) introduce the SPECIAL Policy Log Vocabulary, documenting data transfer details. Fatema et al. ([fatema2017a]) present the CDMM, documenting data transfers comprehensively. Kirrane et al. ([kirrane2018a]) offer a transparency dashboard recording data processing and sharing events. Despite these advancements, gaps remain. Ujcich et al. ([ujcich2018a]) do not explicitly address the legal basis for transfers. Bonatti et al. ([bonatti2018d]) and Fatema et al. ([fatema2017a]) may lack granularity for specific scenarios and mechanisms for ensuring data accuracy and prompt updates. Kirrane et al. ([kirrane2018a]) do not handle data destruction explicitly. Thus, while these studies provide valuable frameworks, they are insufficient to fully address listing all data transfers with every necessary detail for GDPR compliance.

The question of whether there is a legal basis for data transfer, such as an EU Commission adequacy decision or standard contractual clauses, and whether these bases are documented, is addressed to varying extents by studies. Bonatti et al. ([bonatti2018d]) introduce the `LegalBasis` component within their SPECIAL Policy Log Vocabulary. Fatema et al. ([fatema2017a]) incorporate a `Permission` component within their CDMM model. Torre et al. ([torre2021a]) provide a model including adequacy decisions and binding corporate rules. Kirrane et al. ([kirrane2018a]) utilize the SPECIAL usage policy language. While each study contributes valuable components for documenting the legal basis for data transfers, they exhibit insufficiencies. Bonatti et al. ([bonatti2018d]) and Fatema et al. ([fatema2017a]) might need additional components for proper management across jurisdictions. Torre et al. ([torre2021a]) provide a high-level framework but may lack detailed operational procedures. Kirrane et al. ([kirrane2018a]) focus on transparency but do not handle data destruction enforcement. Thus, while these studies offer significant strides, they collectively fall short of a complete solution for documenting the legal basis for data transfers across varying regulatory environments.
