    "Question 8": "The study presented by Ryan et al. [ryan2021a] introduces a semantic metadata-based approach to documenting data processing activities, incorporating DCAT-AP and DPV to specify retention periods within metadata. This method directly facilitates the listing of retention periods for each category of personal data, thereby aligning with the question of how long data will be retained. However, [ryan2021a] does not provide comprehensive mechanisms for ensuring that all data transfers, including detailed recipient information and legal bases, are documented, thus falling short in fully addressing the question's requirements.\n\nCampagna et al. [campagna2020a] propose an enhanced data provenance model that uses `startedAtTime` and `endedAtTime` relations to specify the duration for which each category of personal data is retained. This contributes to answering the question on retention periods. Nonetheless, the model lacks components for ensuring data accuracy, enforcing retention policies, and systematically handling data erasure, leaving it insufficient for fully addressing the question.\n\nBesik and Freytag [besik2019a] introduce the PaCW Ontology, which includes the 'Limited Retention Period' principle to ensure data is erased when no longer necessary. This principle partially answers the question by ensuring data is retained only for the necessary period. However, the approach does not explicitly cover the detailed tracking and documentation of data transfers or the legal basis for these transfers, thus inadequately addressing the question.\n\nBonatti et al. [bonatti2020a] use the SPECIAL policy language to encode envisaged time limits for data erasure, directly addressing retention period requirements. Despite this alignment, the approach does not provide explicit methods for ensuring data accuracy, systematic data destruction, or documenting the legal bases for data transfers, rendering it incomplete in addressing the question.\n\nFatema et al. [fatema2017a] present the Consent and Data Management Model (CDMM), which tracks the lifecycle of consent and data, including retention periods, through its Provenance component. This model aids in listing retention periods for each data category. However, the model might lack the granularity required for all retention scenarios and does not fully ensure that all data remains up-to-date across multiple systems, thus not fully addressing the question.\n\nKirrane et al. [kirrane2018a] propose the SPECIAL system, which uses RDF vocabularies to document retention periods for each category of personal data, aligning with GDPR requirements. The system can specify retention periods through the SPECIAL usage policy language. Nevertheless, it does not explicitly handle the destruction, erasure, or anonymization of data, which means it cannot fully address the question regarding data retention periods.",
    "Question 28": "The question of whether procedures are in place to ensure personal data is kept up to date and accurate, and whether necessary corrections are made without delay, has been approached by various studies, each contributing valuable insights but also exhibiting certain limitations.\n\nRyan et al. [ryan2021a] propose a metadata-based approach using a data processing activities catalog to document procedures for ensuring data accuracy and updates. While the catalog's design, which includes assigning contact points and limiting the scope to organizational units, supports maintaining up-to-date and accurate data, it falls short by not providing specific mechanisms for timely data corrections, thus requiring supplementary systems for comprehensive data quality management.\n\nPandit et al. [pandit2018f] employ P-Plan to track the provenance of activities, contributing to data accuracy by recording and linking changes back to original activities. Although this ensures that corrections are made without delay, the approach is limited in scope, focusing primarily on consent changes and not fully addressing the broader context of continuous data accuracy and timely updates across diverse systems.\n\nUjcich et al. [ujcich2018a] present a provenance model incorporating timestamps and data change tracking, which supports the requirement to keep data up to date and accurate. However, the model lacks specific mechanisms for ensuring ongoing data accuracy and prompt corrections, indicating a need for integration with other data quality management tools to address these aspects comprehensively.\n\nBesik et al. [besik2019a] introduce the Privacy-aware Clinical Workflow (PaCW) Ontology, which includes a 'Consent Check' component that ensures lawful data processing and necessary changes when consent is updated, indirectly supporting data accuracy. Nonetheless, the model does not explicitly address mechanisms for ensuring data remains accurate and up to date, indicating gaps in its application outside the consent context.\n\nFatema et al. [fatema2017a] propose a Consent and Data Management Model (CDMM) that focuses on the lifecycle of consent and data, with processes and obligations defining procedures for data correction and updates. While this ensures necessary changes are made without delay, the model might lack detailed mechanisms to automatically ensure data remains up to date across multiple databases, particularly in complex environments, requiring further refinement.\n\nKirrane et al. [kirrane2018a] develop a compliance dashboard that records and monitors data processing events, supporting the verification of procedures for keeping personal data up-to-date and accurate. Despite its robust transparency features, the system does not explicitly handle the destruction, erasure, or anonymization of data, which are critical for maintaining data accuracy over its lifecycle, indicating a need for additional functionality to cover these areas.\n\nIn summary, while each study provides valuable contributions towards ensuring data accuracy and timely updates, they also exhibit specific limitations. Addressing these gaps through integration with comprehensive data quality management systems and enhancing existing models to include detailed mechanisms for continuous data accuracy can provide a more holistic solution to the posed question.",
    "Question 29": "In addressing the question of whether retention policies and procedures are in place to ensure data are held for no longer than necessary for the purposes for which they were collected, several studies offer relevant insights, though each has its limitations. Ryan et al. [ryan2021a] present an approach using DCAT-AP and DPV to document data processing activities and their temporal periods, which aids in listing retention periods for personal data. However, while the use of catalogs and SPARQL queries assists in monitoring compliance, the study does not comprehensively cover the granularity required for all potential retention scenarios, especially across diverse data categories.\n\nBesik and Freytag [besik2019a] introduce the PaCW Ontology, incorporating the 'Limited Retention Period' principle to ensure data is not held longer than necessary. Yet, the ontology lacks detailed tracking of data transfers and legal bases, which are critical for comprehensive compliance with data retention policies. Similarly, Bonatti et al. [bonatti2020a] leverage the SPECIAL policy language to encode retention policies, aligning with Article 30 of the GDPR. Despite this, the approach does not explicitly address the systematic destruction, erasure, or anonymization of data, which is essential for full compliance.\n\nFatema et al. [fatema2017a] propose the Consent and Data Management Model (CDMM), using the Permission and Provenance components to manage retention policies and provide an audit trail. Nonetheless, the model may need more detailed guidelines and enforcement mechanisms across complex environments to ensure data is not retained longer than necessary in all possible scenarios. Finally, Kirrane et al. [kirrane2018a] offer a scalable compliance architecture with a usage policy language that includes provisions for defining retention policies. While the system provides transparency and supports adherence to retention requirements, it does not explicitly handle the destruction, erasure, or anonymization of data, limiting its ability to fully address this compliance question.\n\nThese studies collectively contribute valuable methodologies for documenting and managing data retention policies. However, each falls short in providing a comprehensive solution that addresses all aspects of ensuring data is held no longer than necessary, highlighting the need for further research and development in this area.",
    "Question 51": "The relationship between existing studies and the question of whether personal data are systematically destroyed, erased, or anonymized when no longer legally required reveals both potential contributions and notable insufficiencies. For instance, the study by Ryan et al. ([ryan2021a]) introduces a data processing activities catalog that documents the lifecycle of such activities, including the destruction, erasure, or anonymization of personal data. This catalog supports systematic handling when data are no longer required. However, it lacks explicit mechanisms to ensure comprehensive listing and enforcement of data retention policies, which may need additional components to fully address systematic data handling when legal requirements lapse.\n\nSimilarly, Pandit et al. ([pandit2018f]) employ P-Plan to track the provenance of data destruction activities, recording workflow changes when data are no longer needed. This approach contributes to demonstrating compliance but does not provide detailed mechanisms for enforcing systematic data destruction procedures, thereby requiring additional policies or components to ensure thorough compliance.\n\nUjcich et al. ([ujcich2018a]) propose a provenance model that maintains records of data destruction, erasure, or anonymization actions, documenting these processes. Nevertheless, this model does not offer specific procedures or controls for systematically handling data when it is no longer necessary, indicating the need for supplementary processes to achieve full compliance.\n\nConversely, Besik and Freytag ([besik2019a]) address the systematic destruction, erasure, or anonymization of data through the 'Limited Retention Period' principle within their Privacy-aware Clinical Workflow (PaCW) Ontology. While this principle aligns with the requirement for systematic data handling, the approach does not cover detailed tracking and documentation of all data transfers, nor does it document the legal bases for such transfers, highlighting gaps that must be bridged for comprehensive compliance.\n\nIn summary, while these studies contribute valuable insights and tools toward ensuring that personal data are systematically destroyed, erased, or anonymized when no longer legally required, they also exhibit insufficiencies that necessitate further development and integration of additional processes and controls to fully address the compliance question.",
    "Question 63": "Ujcich et al.'s [ujcich2018a] provenance model for GDPR compliance includes components for tracking data transfers, detailing the origins and destinations of data. While this model supports the requirement to document data transfers, it lacks specific mechanisms to document the legal justifications for these transfers, thereby falling short in fully addressing the complexities of international data transfers. Bonatti et al.'s [bonatti2018d] SPECIAL Policy Log Vocabulary offers a structured approach through its `ProcessingActivity` and `DataTransfer` components, capturing data nature, processing purposes, and transfer details. However, it does not include explicit components for documenting data retention periods or ensuring data accuracy and prompt correction, which are crucial for comprehensive GDPR compliance. Fatema et al.'s [fatema2017a] Consent and Data Management Model (CDMM) uses a provenance component to document all data transfers and includes mechanisms for managing consent and data lifecycle. Despite its detailed tracking capabilities, it may not fully cover the complexities involved in international data transfers or provide the granularity required for various retention scenarios. Kirrane et al.'s [kirrane2018a] transparency dashboard records data processing and sharing events, which can detail the nature, origin, destination, and recipient of data. While this system aids in documenting data transfers, it does not explicitly address the destruction, erasure, or anonymization of data, thereby leaving a gap in fulfilling all aspects of GDPR compliance related to data transfers.",
    "Question 64": "The transfer of personal data across borders necessitates a documented legal basis to ensure compliance with GDPR requirements. Several studies have proposed frameworks to address this need, though each exhibits certain limitations. The study by Bonatti et al. [bonatti2018d] introduces the `LegalBasis` component within the SPECIAL Policy Log Vocabulary, designed to document legal bases such as EU Commission adequacy decisions or standard contractual clauses. While this approach ensures that data controllers can demonstrate compliance, it primarily focuses on logging and does not provide mechanisms for managing the complexities of compliance across different jurisdictions.\n\nFatema et al. [fatema2017a] present the Consent and Data Management Model (CDMM), which includes a `Permission` component to record the legal basis for data transfers. This model aims to manage information within the CDMM to demonstrate compliance effectively. However, the framework may require additional components to ensure comprehensive documentation and management of legal bases across varying jurisdictions, making it insufficient for complete cross-jurisdictional compliance management.\n\nThe approach by Torre et al. [torre2021a] extends the GDPR conceptual model to include adequacy decisions and appropriate safeguards like EU model clauses. While it provides a robust framework for documenting and verifying the legal basis for data transfer, it falls short in operationalizing these components to ensure thorough compliance, particularly in dynamically changing regulatory environments.\n\nKirrane et al. [kirrane2018a] propose a system that documents the legal basis for data transfers using the SPECIAL usage policy language. This system supports real-time compliance verification and transparency regarding data processing and sharing events. However, it does not explicitly cover the destruction, erasure, or anonymization of data, which is crucial for ensuring full compliance with GDPR requirements. This gap suggests that while the system can document legal bases, it cannot entirely manage the lifecycle of compliance actions needed for data transfers."
