You are extending the GDPRov, which is a data provenance model designed to assist the controllers to track the activities and consent information related to the processing of personal data subject to the General Data Protection Regulation.

The first version of the GPDRov covered part of the official compliance question extracted from official guideline documents. However, GDPRov lacks of components to answer the following questions:

- **Question 8**: For each category of personal data, list the period for which the data will be retained e.g. one month? one year? As a general rule data must be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purpose for which it was collected in the first place.
- **Question 28**: Are procedures in place to ensure personal data is kept up to date and accurate and where a correction is required, the necessary changes are made without delay?
- **Question 29**: Are retention policies and procedures in place to ensure data are held for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which they were collected?
- **Question 51**: Are personal data systematically destroyed, erased, or anonymised when they are no longer legally required to be retained.
- **Question 63**: Are all transfers listed - including answers to the previous questions (e.g. the nature of the data, the purpose of the processing, from which country the data is exported and which country receives the data and who the recipient of the transfer is?)
- **Question 64**: Is there a legal basis for the transfer, e.g. EU Commission adequacy decision; standard contractual clauses. Are these bases documented?

Please provide a comprehensive summary about the publication detailed behind, including:

- From two to three paragraphs introducing the approach used and its motivations;
- How this approach is related with each of thoses compliance question above, if it have some relation;
- Why this approach is not capable to answer each of those question completely;
- The key contributions (in bullet points);
- How the current model advances the state-of-the-art; and
- if possible, the link where the introduced model is public available

## Approach and Motivations

{{from three to five paragraphs introducing the approach, describing the structure of this paper, the motivations that led to this approach and all components introduced by the publication model (if exist a model) DO NOT CREATE NON-EXITING COMPONENTS, JUST USE THOSE IN THE DOCUMENT!; and if exist and it is necessary, link the main figures and tables introduced in the publication}}

## Approach Contribution For The Compliance Questions

{{up to two paragragraphs for each compliance question that certently existing components can contribute (highlighing the componets of this model, with `ComponentaName` notation, that might be used to answer this question. DO NOT CREATE NON-EXITING COMPONENTS, JUST USE THOSE IN THE DOCUMENT!). If this approach have no relation to a question, then skip the question}}

## Approach Insuficiecies For Fulfill The Compliance Questions

{{up to two paragraph for each compliance question explaining why this model/approach cannot conver the question: because it lacks some component, because it uses a different technologies from RDF technologies, etc.}}

## Key Contributions

{{bullet points gathering the main contribution of this approach, the technology used, a sub-list with all introduced components (if possible), the background concepts to understand this approach, and a brief description about how this model is evaluated; BE EXAHAUSTIVE WITH THIS LIST}}

## State-of-the-Art

{{up to four paragraph introducing how this approach contributes for the advancing of the state-of-the-art, and what are the related work competling with this approach}}
