# CQ63

Are all transfers listed - including answers to the previous questions (e.g. the nature of the data, the purpose of the processing, from which country the data is exported and which country receives the data and who the recipient of the transfer is?)

## Discussion

Pandit just states this question cannot be evaluated prorammatically. He does not provide further comments about it. We think this is not the case, since we capture in the provenance graph the transfers activities. When he comments the CQ64 (which the answer lies the same nature of this question), he clarifies he is assuming that the provenance graph does not capture the transfered information.
