Are retention policies and procedures in place to ensure data are held for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which they were collected?

Pandit places the difficult of this question consists of verifying programmatically whether a piece of data has been deleted by an automated procedure when the purpose for which it was collected has been fulfilled.

It seems to me his position lies in detecting whether the purpose for which the data was collected is no longer necessary. However, we can argue that such an event must occur at the same time as the expiry of the legal basis for which the data was initially collected. In other words, we can unite purpose and legal basis.

Does it make sense to separate these two concepts in this context? See how the literature treats this discussion. See also the DPV. The definitions there.
