Ontology Engineering Methodologies

Knowledge in the form of ontologies is built since decades. Sequential [10, 36], iterative [20, 5] and even agile [28, 21, 29] Ontology Engineering methodologies were proposed, all aiming to transform the art of building ontologies into an engineering activity [34].

One common methodology is NeOn [34], a scenario-based methodology with the aim to modularize Ontology Engineering activities. Therefore, NeOn relied on state-of-the-art methodologies and its authors also published a list with common activities to push standardization efforts further [33]. This NeOn glossary of processes and activities [33] provides a comprehensive list of ontology engineering processes and activities. This glossary covers also activities related to Ontology Design Patterns [13], which aim to serve as building blocks to approach common modeling and publishing challenges

Ontology Engineering activities collected from the mentioned methodologies and the glossary, as well as Ontology Design Patterns are the state-of-the-art, and serve as basis for my research, investigating the modeling of restrictions.
