The MeLOn methodology is composed of ten recursive steps: 
1. **Describe the goal of the ontology**. PrOnto’s goals are: 
	- to model data protection legal norms starting form legal texts but including also social norms, practitioners’ opinions or social behaviours; 
	- to build a legal ontology that is usable for legal reasoning; 
	- to build a legal ontology that is usable for data and information retrieval. 
2. **Evaluation indicators**. PrOnto’s criteria, based on the existing state of the art, are (Bandeira et al., 2016): (i) coherence, (ii) completeness, (iii) efficiency, (iv) effectiveness, (v) usability, (vi) agreement.
3. **State of the art survey**: PrOnto reuses existing ontologies, ontology patterns (Hitzler et al., 2016), and other existing domain vocabularies. 
4. **List the whole relevant terminology**: extracted from legal sources, in particular legal definitions.
5. **Use usable tools**: e.g. tables, UML diagrams and the Graffoo tool2.
6. **Refine and optimize**: an ontology experts manually adds the axioms.
7. **Test the output**: in terms of completeness, effectiveness and usability.
8. **Evaluate the ontology**: OntoClean method and SPARQL queries.
9. **Publish the documen**t with the LODE tool3 (Peroni et al., 2012).
10. **Collect feedbacks** from the community in order to reach the agreement criteria.

The MeLOn methodology permits to work with success inside interdisciplinary group that include engineers, lawyers, linguists, logicians and ontologists, and to model the legal knowledge rapidly, accurately and integrating the contributions of different disciplines.
