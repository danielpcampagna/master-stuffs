The **Publishing Workflow Ontology (PWO)** is a simple ontology written in OWL 2 DL for the characterization of the main stages in the workflow associated with the publication of a document (e.g., being written, under review, XML capture, page design, publication on the Web). We reuse the workflow pattern to model the different types of processing of personal data (Gangemi et al., 2017).
