Provenance is information about entities, activities, and people (or software) involved in producing data or a component which can be used to form an assessment about its quality, reliability, or trustworthiness. The PROV-O ontology [47] along with PROV family of schemas and documents is the W3C recommendation for representing provenance information since 30th April 2013 and has seen significant adoption by semantic web and industrial communities. It provides definitions for interchange of provenance information by representing entities and relations between them such as generated by, derived from, and attributions.

The core concepts of PROV-O are summarised in Figure 5.4 and consist of interactions between Activities, Entities, and Agents. An Entity in PROV-O is defined as being physical, digital, conceptual, or other kind of ‘thing’ with some fixed aspects. PROV-O defines an Activity as something that occurs over a period of time and acts upon or with entities; it may include consuming, processing, transforming, modifying, relocating, using, or generating entities.
