**Time-indexed Value in Context (TVC)** is an ontology pattern that allows to describe scenarios in which someone (e.g., a person) has a value (e.g., a particular role) during a particular time and for a particular context. We use this portion of ontology to connect the event with value, context and time parameters (Peroni et al., 2017).
