PrOnto is composed of the following modules:
1. data and documents;
2. agents and roles;
3. processing purposes and legal bases;
4. data processing and workflow; and
5. legal rules and deontic operators.

"PrOnto includes a specific module for managing risks, measures and management of the risk checking using OWL."

### Detection of violations

"The steps are connected with LegalRule that is the deontic part of the ontology capable to model and make reasoning with right, obligation, permission, prohibition."
