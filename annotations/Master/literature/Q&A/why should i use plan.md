"Human activities can be modelled through a workflow, i.e., a sequence of steps that takes some resources in input and produces certain outcomes. However, a workflow is composed of two parts: ==first a plan to do something is laid out (e.g., workflow), then the concrete sequence of actions is actually performed (e.g., execution of the workflow). This distinction is of utmost relevance in the GDPR framework: the plan (e.g., Impact Assessment Plan made by steps) is different from the real execution (e.g., the countermeasures acted in the event of a data breach), which is made up of a set of actions. Compliance checking presumes both a plan in line with the law, and countermeasures in the event of violations during the actual execution (e.g., remedies).=="
