### Limitations
"GDPRtEXT [18] provides a list of concepts present in the GDPR text without really entering the modelling of the norms and the legal axioms (e.g., the actions performed by the processor, the obligations of the controller and the rights of the data subject). Morover ==GDPRtEXT does not foster FRBR information for managing versioning of the legal text over the time and consequently the changes of the legal concepts due to modifications in the legal system.=="
