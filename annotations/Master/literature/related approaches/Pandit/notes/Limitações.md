"The table demonstrates that GDPRov supports all of analysed features and is the only one currently providing all of them. However, this analysis only takes into consideration abstract existence or provision of features and does not take into consideration context of an approach or its granularity. For example, while an approach may provide representation of data storage concepts, there are additional features such as storage duration, condition, form or medium, security, and policy which are also relevant in evaluation of GDPR compliance. These are highly dependant on individual use-cases and domains, and contain existing work which can be used to represent them such as Time ontology [184] for temporal annotations and ODRL ontology [185] for conditions and events as policies. Since the scope of GDPRov is limited to expression of information regarding activities in ex-ante and ex-post phases, representation of such granular attributes is relevant but not the primary focus within its scope and is therefore not considered in its evaluation or comparison with SotA."

Em síntese, o trabalho do [[pandit, 2022]] foca em representar atividades ex-ante e ex-post. Outras abordagens têm focos diferentes; p.e., representar uma ontologia temporal, ou condicional, ou ainda recurosos como duração do armazenamento de um dado, condição, forma, meio segurança, politica de acesso, etc.
