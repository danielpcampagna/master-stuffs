The SPECIAL project uses a scenario45 to motivate their work and demonstrate use of developed technologies in their deliverables (D1.7 [186]) and peer-reviewed publications ([85]). In this section, the scenario is adapted as an external use-case to evaluate GDPRov’s suitability to express required concepts.

The use-case is summarised as follows with GDPR concepts added in parenthesis for relevance: Sue (Data Subject) buys a wearable appliance for fitness tracking from BeFit (Data Controller), and is presented with an informed consent request that describes collection of biomedical parameters such as heart rate (Personal Data) and how they will be processed, which are stored in BeFit’s cloud and transmitted for purposes of: giving Sue feedback on her activity, such as calories consumption; and creating an activity profile that will be shared with other companies for targeted ads related to fitness - an optional purpose to which Sue opts-in. After two years, Sue starts receiving annoying SMS messages from a local gym that advertise its activities. Sue discovers following facts: (i) the gym has an activity profile referring to Sue, that, due to appliance’s malfunctioning, reports that she is not doing any physical exercise; (ii) the gym received Sue’s profile from BeFit, associated with a policy that allows the gym to send targeted ads to Sue based on the profile; (iii) BeFit built Sue’s profile by mining data collected by appliance; and (iv) all these operations are permitted by consent agreement previously signed by Sue and BeFit. Using this information BeFit and the gym prove that they used Sue’s data in accordance with Sue’s given consent. Sue now asks both BeFit and the gym to delete all of her data.
